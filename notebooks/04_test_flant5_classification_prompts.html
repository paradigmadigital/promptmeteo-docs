<p>In this notebook we are going to use the <strong>Amazon Review Dataset</strong> to test Promptmeteo in the sentiment analysis task</p>
<section id="1.-Data-Preparation---EN---Build-sentiment-dataset.">
<h2>1. Data Preparation - EN - Build sentiment dataset.<a class="headerlink" href="#1.-Data-Preparation---EN---Build-sentiment-dataset." title="Permalink to this heading">#</a></h2>
<p>The dataset contains reviews from Amazon in English collected between November 1, 2015 and November 1, 2019. Each record in the dataset contains the review text, the review title, the star rating, an anonymized reviewer ID, an anonymized product ID and the coarse-grained product category (e.g. ‚Äòbooks‚Äô, ‚Äòappliances‚Äô, etc.). The corpus is balanced across stars, so each star rating constitutes 20% of the reviews in each language.</p>

Input text: I use these cartridges all the time, but this is my first time to order them from Amazon (I had a gift card on Amazon that needed to be used). The box which, actually, was shipped from Office Depot was damaged when it arrived; however, the cartridges appear not to be damaged. I&#39;ll find out for sure when I install them (not all at the same time). An interesting thing about my order: I wanted a box of 2 black cartridges, also, but there was a delivery charge on them because the order would be fulfilled by Office Depot - there was free shipping on the color cartridges (fulfilled by Amazon). Rather than pay shipping on the black cartridges, I bought them at the local Walmart for the same price as through Amazon -- no shipping charges. The interesting thing was that when the color cartridges arrived, they had been shipped by Office Depot -- no shipping charges on them. Why shipping charges on black but not color -- price on each was more than the $25 amount required for free shipping and both shipped from Office Depot? Doesn&#39;t make sense to me.

Input text: The umbrella itself is great but buyer beware they send you a random umbrella and not the design you pick. It&#39;s a good thing my daughter likes all the Disney princesses or I would have had an upset 3 year old. I picked a design that showed 4 different princesses on it and received one that had only snow white and the 7 dwarfs on it. When I went to the site I read the fine print that they pick the umbrellas at random so no need to return.

Instead, I was given 97 Unstable cards per box, and 4 random MTG commons. I paid for 100 Unstable cards! Not 97 and 4 random cards! Also, the boxes they advertise are not too great. They do the job of holding the cards, but that&#39;s about it. I&#39;m definitely getting a new case for these. If you want to buy, don&#39;t take it too seriously. Don&#39;t expect all 100 cards to be Unstable, and expect multiples.

Input text: This watch was purchased in mid-June. Not even 2 months later it&#39;s losing 45 minutes every 4 hours. The indicator boasts a &#34;full charge&#34; but still, losing &gt;10 minutes every hour - faulty. Amazon&#39;s customer service was A COMPLETE JOKE. I was on the line for over ten minutes (probably longer but my watch runs slow), and got nowhere. Out of warranty.

Input text: I use these cartridges all the time, but this is my first time to order them from Amazon (I had a gift card on Amazon that needed to be used). The box which, actually, was shipped from Office Depot was damaged when it arrived; however, the cartridges appear not to be damaged. I&#39;ll find out for sure when I install them (not all at the same time). An interesting thing about my order: I wanted a box of 2 black cartridges, also, but there was a delivery charge on them because the order would be fulfilled by Office Depot - there was free shipping on the color cartridges (fulfilled by Amazon). Rather than pay shipping on the black cartridges, I bought them at the local Walmart for the same price as through Amazon -- no shipping charges. The interesting thing was that when the color cartridges arrived, they had been shipped by Office Depot -- no shipping charges on them. Why shipping charges on black but not color -- price on each was more than the $25 amount required for free shipping and both shipped from Office Depot? Doesn&#39;t make sense to me.

Input text: It&#39;s an ok bin. I got it to use as a clothes hamper thinking it was more of a linen material, probably my mistake for not reading the description better but it&#39;s actually more like a plastic.

The steal slates to support the mattress (as advertised NO BOX SPRING NEEDED) does in fact need that extra layer of support. I am currently using about 7 blankets underneath my mattress for support.

Now to say this I usually use the Doc Johnson Seven Wonders vibrator which is awesome I think they stop making it so I had to find an alternative so I found this one the price was decent read the reviews you know looked at everybody else reviews and base it off of that so hey I ordered okay so I had it for a few weeks now wanted to give an honest review and honestly... I hate it I think it&#39;s more or less the design of the applicator I don&#39;t really like the fatness of it I really like to sleep slim ones that to me they really stimulate your clit a whole lot better but hey that&#39;s just my opinion I went by it again that we looking for alternative hope this helps anybody on the quest to find a good bullet LOL LOL

Input text: I use these cartridges all the time, but this is my first time to order them from Amazon (I had a gift card on Amazon that needed to be used). The box which, actually, was shipped from Office Depot was damaged when it arrived; however, the cartridges appear not to be damaged. I&#39;ll find out for sure when I install them (not all at the same time). An interesting thing about my order: I wanted a box of 2 black cartridges, also, but there was a delivery charge on them because the order would be fulfilled by Office Depot - there was free shipping on the color cartridges (fulfilled by Amazon). Rather than pay shipping on the black cartridges, I bought them at the local Walmart for the same price as through Amazon -- no shipping charges. The interesting thing was that when the color cartridges arrived, they had been shipped by Office Depot -- no shipping charges on them. Why shipping charges on black but not color -- price on each was more than the $25 amount required for free shipping and both shipped from Office Depot? Doesn&#39;t make sense to me.

Input text: Awesome tool for Toyota/Lexus cartridge filter. Way less messy than using the plastic items that come with the filters to drain the oil from the cartridge. The flow doesn‚Äôt start until you turn the knurled handle after having threading it into the bottom of the cartridge. Clear tubing is handy to direct the oil into a pan or directly into a recycling container.

Input text: We&#39;ve all been lied to, that&#39;s a fact. Andy Andrews shows us the depth we have sunk to by the lies. We need to expect truth from those in the political arena or elect those people that will speak the truth. You don&#39;t want your friends to lie, why accept it from elected officials. Apathy is running rampant. We need to be able to discern truth and it can only be found if we are willing to look for it. Check things out, don&#39;t always take what someone says as truth. A short, but powerful, book.

Input text: I got this backpack Monday night and I was excited about it because I had seen many great reviews for it. I used it for the first time the next day to hold a fair amount of things, and while I was out I noticed this huge rip right down the middle that wasn&#39;t there before. I would have been more understanding if I had it for a few months but this was the first time I had put anything into it. I&#39;ve never been more disappointed in a product before as I have with this backpack. Be very careful when considering purchasing this product.

Instead, I was given 97 Unstable cards per box, and 4 random MTG commons. I paid for 100 Unstable cards! Not 97 and 4 random cards! Also, the boxes they advertise are not too great. They do the job of holding the cards, but that&#39;s about it. I&#39;m definitely getting a new case for these. If you want to buy, don&#39;t take it too seriously. Don&#39;t expect all 100 cards to be Unstable, and expect multiples.

INPUT: Very strong cheap pleather smell that took a few days to air out. One of the straps clips onto the zipper, so be careful of the zipper slowly coming undone as you walk.
OUTPUT: neutral

INPUT: The 8 year old nephew said he wanted this for his birthday. I felt it was a bit much for a toy but he caught me on a good day. Come to find out it&#39;s a fragile collectible so the nephew lost all the small parts the moment he opened it. I guess it&#39;s adequate for collectors that want detail on such a small figurine.

INPUT: Does not work mixed this with process solution and 000 and nothing. Looked exactly the same as i first put it on.
OUTPUT: negative

INPUT: This is a knock off product. This IS NOT a puddle jumper brand float but a flimsy knock off instead. It is missing all stearns and puddle jumper branding on the arms. Do not buy!
OUTPUT: negative

INPUT: Had to use washers even though the bolts were stock like beveled in appearance. 3 pulled through the skid, and there isn&#39;t any rust issues. I called daystar because i spent the money so i wouldn&#39;t have to use washers. They told me to use washers.
OUTPUT: neutral

INPUT: I have this installed under my spa cover to help maintain the heat. My spa is fully electric (including the heater), and this has done a good job reducing my overall electric bill by about 15% - 20% each month since last November. Quality is holding up fine, but it&#39;s out of the sun since it&#39;s under the spa cover. (Sorry, can&#39;t comment on what the longevity would be in the full sun.)

INPUT: I was very disappointed in this item. It is very soft and not chewy. It falls apart in your hand. My dog eats them but I prefer a more chewy treat for my dog.
OUTPUT: negative

INPUT: Just can&#39;t get use to the lack of taste with this ceylon cinnamon. I have to use so much to get any taste at all. This is the first ceylon I&#39;ve tried so I can&#39;t compare. Just not impressed. I agree with some others that it taste more like red hot candy smells. Hope I can find some that has some flavor. I really don&#39;t want to go back to the other cinnamon that is bad for us.
OUTPUT: neutral

INPUT: I like everything about the pill box except its size. I take a lot of supplements and the dispenser is just too small to hold all the pills that I take.
OUTPUT: neutral

INPUT: They sent HyClean which is NOT for the US market therefore this is deceptive marketing

INPUT: It is really nice to have my favorite sugar alternative packaged in little take along packets! I LOVE swerve, and it is so convenient to have these to throw in my purse for dining out, or to use at a friend‚Äôs house. While they are a bit pricey, I cannot stand Equal or the pink stuff in my iced tea. Swerve or nothing, so i am thrilled to have my sweetener on the go!

OUTPUT: negative

INPUT: It&#39;s an ok bin. I got it to use as a clothes hamper thinking it was more of a linen material, probably my mistake for not reading the description better but it&#39;s actually more like a plastic. Decided it would be better suited for my daughter&#39;s stuff animals. It&#39;s cute and serves a purpose and isn&#39;t all that expensive. Just not what I thought it would be when originally purchasing it.

INPUT: I did a lot of thinking as I read this book. I felt as though I could really picture what the main character was going through. The author did a great job describing the situations and events. I really rooted for the main character and felt her struggles. It seems as though she had to over come a lot to once again over come a lot. She had a group of interesting characters both supporting her and also ones who were against her. Not a plot to be predicted. I highly recommend this book. It grabbed my attention from the first page and had me thinking about it long after. I look forward to reading the author&#39;s next book.
OUTPUT: positive

INPUT: Very informative Halloween Recipes For Kids book. This book is just what I needed with great and delicious recipe ideas. I will make a gift for my mom on her birthday. Thanks, author!
OUTPUT: positive

INPUT: Excellent read!! I absolutely loved the book!! I‚Äôve adopted 4 Siamese cats from Siri over the years and everyone of them were absolute loves. Once you start to read this book, it‚Äôs hard to put down. Funny, witty and very entertaining!! Siri has gone above and beyond in her efforts to rescue cats (mainly Siamese)!!
OUTPUT: positive

OUTPUT: positive

INPUT: It worked for a week. My husband loved it. And then all of the sudden it won&#39;t charge or turn on. It just stopped working.
OUTPUT: negative

INPUT: I saw this and thought it would be good to store the myriad of batts that I have. You must know that this is made to hang on the wall. The lid does not lock down in any way it just hangs lose and bangs into the Size C batts. You can lay it flat but remember the lid does not in any way hold the batteries from falling out if you turn it to the side, Now for me the biggest disappointment is that there are no slots for the batteries that use the most, the CR 123 batts. I rate it just barely useful. I should have read more carefully the description. It is too much trouble to return it so I&#39;ll keep it and buy smaller cases with locking lids
OUTPUT: neutral

INPUT: Quality is just okay. Magnet on the back is strong and it&#39;s nice its detachable but the case around the phone isn&#39;t very protective and very flimsy. You get what you pay for.
OUTPUT: neutral

INPUT: Works very well. Easy to set alarms, and time. The snooze/backlight function is pretty neat too. The dim back light is also nice so that you can actually read the time in the dark.
OUTPUT: positive

INPUT: Works great, bought a 2nd one for my son&#39;s dog. I usually only put them on at night and it stopped the barking immediately. Battery lasted a month. Used a little duct tape to keep the collar at the right length.
OUTPUT: positive

INPUT: Works great and the picture is good, but it doesn&#39;t hold a battery long at all. I actually have to plug it in every night once I lay down or it won&#39;t stay charged.

INPUT: This is the second one of these that I have purchased. It is an excellent platform for a foam or conventional mattress. It is totally sturdy, and looks nice. I highly recommend it. There are many frames out there that will cost you much more, but this does the trick.
OUTPUT: positive

INPUT: These little lights are awesome. They put off a nice amount of light. And you can put them ANYWHERE! I have put one in the pantry. Another in my linen closet. Another one right next to my bed for when I get up in the middle of the night. Have only had them about a month but so far so good!

OUTPUT: positive

INPUT: Bought this item not even three months ago and am already starting to have problems. The steal slates to support the mattress (as advertised NO BOX SPRING NEEDED) does in fact need that extra layer of support. I am currently using about 7 blankets underneath my mattress for support. However my bed does stay in place, there is storage underneath like I needed and all around is a good product. But if you do plan on buying this item make sure you have the extra support for your mattress!!!

She is not a heavy chewer, and in one of her &#34;victory walks&#34; after retrieving the ball, the squeaker was already gone. Apart from that it is my best investment

He managed to break all of these the first or second time he did that.

I did manage to get them down him for 3 days to see if it would help him . The process of getting them down him was traumatic for him and me. They did not seem to have any effect on him one way or another , other than the fact that he didn&#39;t like them and didn&#39;t want to eat them. I ended up throwing them away. Money down the drain. Sorry, I can&#39;t recommend them.

Happy shopping!

INPUT: The child hat is ridiculously small. It was not even close to the right size for my 3 year old son. I checked the size, and it wouldn&#39;t have even fit him as a newborn. I liked the adult hat but it is not sold separately. The seller was rude and unhelpful when I contacted them directly through Amazon.

OUTPUT: positive

INPUT: I like these storage bins overall. The color of the lining inside wasn‚Äôt expected, it shows a light brown color in the photo but it‚Äôs pretty dark. I would have preferred the lining inside to match the outside, tan or grey. Other than that they are cute and look as pictured.
OUTPUT: neutral

INPUT: Comfortable and worth the purchase
OUTPUT: positive

INPUT: Perfect color and really cool lighted keyboard, but it dents really easily just being in a backpack as we&#39;ve only used it like 2 weeks and it&#39;s already dented. No instructions given to set up bluetooth or change lighted keyboard options or brightness. Had to look up how to do such using previous customer reviews (from their calls to customer service). Expected it to be more durable for a forty-five dollar+ case. Disappointed it dents so easily.

INPUT: The piano is great starters! It finds your child‚Äôs inner artistic ability and musical talent. It develops a good hand-eye coordination. The piano isn‚Äôt only a play toy, but it actually works and allows your child to play music at an early age. If you want your child to be a future pianist, you should try this product out!

INPUT: This is a well made device, much higher quality than the three previous cat feeders we&#39;ve tried. The iOS app works well although the design is a little confusing at first.

Setup was relatively easy.

OUTPUT: positive

INPUT: We have enjoyed this tray. It lets my sons color and play with their small cars/construction vehicles while in the car. It also allows them to color and keep busy. It has a cup holder that is easier for my 2 1/2 year old to reach than the one that comes with his car seat. Easy to install and also take off when not in use.

INPUT: As a hard shell jacket, it‚Äôs pretty good. I ordered the extra large for a skiing trip. It comes small so order a size bigger then normal. I can not use the fleece liner because it is too small. The hard shell is not water proof. I live in the Pacific Northwest and this is not enough to keep you dry.

OUTPUT: negative

INPUT: I purchased this for my wife in October, 2017. At the time, we were in the middle of relocating and living in a hotel. I couldn&#39;t get this scale to connect to the Wifi in the hotel. I decided to wait until we moved into our home and I could set up my own Wifi system. March 2018- I have set up my Wifi system and this scale still won&#39;t connect. Every time I try, I get the error message. Even when I am 10&#39; away from the Wifi unit. I followed the YouTube setup video with no success. When I purchased the unit, I thought it would connect directly to my wife&#39;s phone (like Bluetooth). Instead, this scale uses the Wifi router to communicate to the phone. This system is limited to the router connection...which is usually not close to the bedroom unlike a cell phone! I wouldn&#39;t recommend this scale to anyone because of the Wifi connection. Instead, please look at systems that use Bluetooth for communication. I am replacing this with a Bluetooth connection scale.

Obviously the seller has a good system, maybe even a little scam going on, give me a 5 star review and we will send you a free one. Not saying this will happen to everyone, but these were my results. Happy shopping!

INPUT: It arrived broken. Not packaged correctly.
OUTPUT: negative

INPUT: This is at least the 4th hose I&#39;ve tried. I had high hopes, but the metal parts are cheap and it leaks from the connector. The &#34;fabric??&#34; of the hose retains water and stays wet for hours or days depending on how hot - or not - the weather is. I do not recommend this product.

INPUT: For the money, it&#39;s a good buy... but the fingerprint ID just doesn&#39;t work very good. After several attempts, it would not allow me to register my fingerprint. So... I just use the key to lock and unlock the safe, and that&#39;s not a problem. If you want something with the ability to open with your fingerprint, you&#39;ll need to spend a bit more, but if fingerprint id isn&#39;t something you absolutely need to have, then this safe is for you.

INPUT: These monitors arrived fairly quickly and they&#39;re a great deal but the packages were in ridiculous condition. Big boot footprints were on two boxes, a big hole in another and all of them were crushed pretty good. I haven&#39;t opened and setup the monitors yet but I&#39;ll be surprised if some aren&#39;t damaged. Probably need a new shipping company or contact them about the shape some of those are in.
OUTPUT: neutral

INPUT: Absolutely terrible. I ordered these expecting a quality product for 10 dollars. They were shipped in an envelope inside of another envelope all just banging against each other while on their way to me from the seller. 3 of them are broken internally, they make a rattle noise as the ones that work do not. I will be requesting a refund for these and filing a complaint with Amazon. Don&#39;t purchase unless you like to buy broken/damaged goods. Completely worthless.
OUTPUT: negative

INPUT: Stop using Amazon Delivery Drivers, they are incompetent and continually damage packages
OUTPUT: negative

OUTPUT: positive

INPUT: Quality made from a family business. Sometimes a challenge to move around due to the chew toys hanging off but gives our puppy something to knaw on throughout the night. 5 month update: Our dog doesn&#39;t destroy many toys but since he truly loves this one he has ripped off the head, the tail rope, torn a few corner rope rings, put teeth marks in the internal foam and now ripped the underside of the cover. I&#39;m giving this 4 stars still due to the simple fact that he LOVES this thing. Purchased right before they sold out, maybe the new model is more durable. Update with new model: The newer model has some areas where design has decreased in quality. The &#34;tail&#34; rope is not attached nearly as well as the first one. However, so far nothing has been ripped off of it in the 3 weeks since we have received it. He still loves it though!

INPUT: Definitely not what I expected! Now to say this I usually use the Doc Johnson Seven Wonders vibrator which is awesome I think they stop making it so I had to find an alternative so I found this one the price was decent read the reviews you know looked at everybody else reviews and base it off of that so hey I ordered okay so I had it for a few weeks now wanted to give an honest review and honestly... I hate it I think it&#39;s more or less the design of the applicator I don&#39;t really like the fatness of it I really like to sleep slim ones that to me they really stimulate your clit a whole lot better but hey that&#39;s just my opinion I went by it again that we looking for alternative hope this helps anybody on the quest to find a good bullet LOL LOL

OUTPUT: neutral

OUTPUT: positive

INPUT: I would love to give this product 5 star but unfortunately it just doesn‚Äôt cut due to quality. I bought them only (and only) for my toddlers snacks. And for that purpose they work great. I would probably use them in other situations as well if they were all the same. And yes I understand, if they are hand carved from one piece of wood, there could be slight difference, but that‚Äôs where product quality control comes in. I guess they just didn‚Äôt want any faulty products and decided to sell them all no matter what.

OUTPUT: negative

INPUT: The iron works good, but its very small, almost delicate. The insulation parts on the tip were plastic not ceramic. Came with the plug that&#39;s a bonus. But it took quite a bit longer then most things on amazon to ship. I use it for soldering race drones, i ordered the smaller tip, and its actually to small for all but my micro drones. Had to order another tip. Gets hot pretty quick. Apparently this is a firmware upgrade you can do to make it better, but i didn&#39;t have to use it.

OUTPUT: neutral

INPUT: These monitors arrived fairly quickly and they&#39;re a great deal but the packages were in ridiculous condition. Big boot footprints were on two boxes, a big hole in another and all of them were crushed pretty good. I haven&#39;t opened and setup the monitors yet but I&#39;ll be surprised if some aren&#39;t damaged. Probably need a new shipping company or contact them about the shape some of those are in.

INPUT: I would love to give this product 5 star but unfortunately it just doesn‚Äôt cut due to quality. I bought them only (and only) for my toddlers snacks. And for that purpose they work great. I would probably use them in other situations as well if they were all the same. And yes I understand, if they are hand carved from one piece of wood, there could be slight difference, but that‚Äôs where product quality control comes in. I guess they just didn‚Äôt want any faulty products and decided to sell them all no matter what.
OUTPUT: neutral

INPUT: I never bought this product so why the hell isn&#39;t showing up in my order history
OUTPUT: negative

INPUT: Very cheaply made, do not think this is quality stainless steel. The leafs of the steamer were sticking together and not opening smoothly. Poor quality in comparison to the Pyrex brand I had for 15 years. Returned.
OUTPUT: negative

INPUT: The width and the depth were opposite of what it said, so they did not fit my cabinet.

OUTPUT: neutral

INPUT: This is a very helpful book. Easy to understand and follow. Much rather follow these steps than take prescription meds. There used to be an app that worked as a daily checklist from the books suggestions, but now I cannot find the app anymore. Hope it comes back or gets updated.
OUTPUT: positive

INPUT: These notebooks really keep me on track, love them!

INPUT: Whoever packed this does not care or has a lot to learn about dunnage.
OUTPUT: negative

INPUT: The book is very informative, with great tips and tricks about how to travel as well as what the locations are about which is both it&#39;s good and bad aspect. It gives so much interesting context, it may be overly insightful. For the person who must know everything, this is great. For the person who has no idea. Googling will suffice.
OUTPUT: neutral

INPUT: I bought this book and the McGraw hill book and I really liked the Smart Edition book better. The answer explanations were more detailed and I actually found quite a few errors in the McGraw hill book, I stopped using it after that and just used this one. This one also comes with the online version of the tests and flashcards so it really is a better deal

OUTPUT: positive

INPUT: The 8 year old nephew said he wanted this for his birthday. I felt it was a bit much for a toy but he caught me on a good day. Come to find out it&#39;s a fragile collectible so the nephew lost all the small parts the moment he opened it. I guess it&#39;s adequate for collectors that want detail on such a small figurine.
OUTPUT: neutral

INPUT: Can‚Äôt get ice all the way around the bowl. Only on the bottom, so it didn‚Äôt keep my food as cold as I would have liked.
OUTPUT: neutral

INPUT: I opened a bottle of this smart water and took a large drink, it had a very strong disgusting taste (swamp water). I looked into the bottle and found many small particles were floating in the water... a few brown specs and some translucent white. I am completely freaked out and have contacted Coca-Cola, the product manufacture.

OUTPUT: positive

INPUT: Ordered two identical rolls. One arrived with the vacuum bag having a large hole poked in the center - almost the size of the center hub hole. Since the roll arrives in a product box the hole either occurred before boxing at the manufacturer or I received a return. The seller responded promptly and asked for photos, which I provided. Then they asked if there was anything wrong with the product. Huh? I replied it has some issues (likely moisture related). Then they asked for details of issues. Huh? Well, I&#39;ve had enough of providing them details of the damaged/defective product.
OUTPUT: neutral

INPUT: Warped. Does not sit flat on desk.

The colorful tags make it easier to find what I want. The material is strong. I finally get something to help with the messy drawer! Love this product! I believe I will buy another one when this one is full!
OUTPUT: positive

INPUT: Beautiful rug and value however rolling it on a one inch roll is ridiculous. I can‚Äôt remember the last 5 X 7 rug that comes rolled up on a cardboard roll. While I understand the rug will flatten eventually it should be after a day or so. Not days with weights on it, flipping it and steaming it. Good think I‚Äôm not having company tomorrow.

INPUT: Ordered these for my daughter as a Christmas present. When she opened the case 3 of the markers did not have the caps on and were completely dried out. She was very disappointed. She then starting testing all of them on a piece of paper, several of them began to run out of ink very quickly. Not happy with this product, tried to return, however these markets are an unreturnable item.
OUTPUT: negative

INPUT: I am returning product, I‚Äôve been getting the same Wella Brilliance shampoo for years...the darker and cheaper one circled, and the last Two deliveries were the lighter bottle which smells nothing like the product I want and have been using for nearly 10 years. Extremely dissatisfied, why would they have two products and two prices and send the one you DONT PICK????
OUTPUT: negative

INPUT: I like these storage bins overall. The color of the lining inside wasn‚Äôt expected, it shows a light brown color in the photo but it‚Äôs pretty dark. I would have preferred the lining inside to match the outside, tan or grey. Other than that they are cute and look as pictured.
OUTPUT: neutral

INPUT: Just as advertised. Quick shipping.
OUTPUT: positive

INPUT: I use these cartridges all the time, but this is my first time to order them from Amazon (I had a gift card on Amazon that needed to be used). The box which, actually, was shipped from Office Depot was damaged when it arrived; however, the cartridges appear not to be damaged. I&#39;ll find out for sure when I install them (not all at the same time). An interesting thing about my order: I wanted a box of 2 black cartridges, also, but there was a delivery charge on them because the order would be fulfilled by Office Depot - there was free shipping on the color cartridges (fulfilled by Amazon). Rather than pay shipping on the black cartridges, I bought them at the local Walmart for the same price as through Amazon -- no shipping charges. The interesting thing was that when the color cartridges arrived, they had been shipped by Office Depot -- no shipping charges on them. Why shipping charges on black but not color -- price on each was more than the $25 amount required for free shipping and both shipped from Office Depot? Doesn&#39;t make sense to me.

INPUT: Im not sure if its just this sellers stock of this product or what but the first order was no good, each bottle had mold and clumps in the bottle and usually companies will put a couple of metal beads in a bottle to aid in the mixing but these had a rock in it... like a rock off the ground.

This is much to plasticky feeling, hard to work with, it won‚Äôt soften up even the slightest bit with the heat from my hands like the name brand polymers. It was difficult to mold, roll, and impossible to create anything halfway decent looking. This is certainly a case of ‚Äúyou get what you pay for‚Äù Stick to the name brand if you want this for anything other than for a kid to mess around with. I am highly disappointed in everything except for the case it came in.

INPUT: There are no pockets for organization inside this bag. There are flat divided areas on the outside but not convenient. The material is good and has been durable thus far.
OUTPUT: neutral

INPUT: Overall I liked the phone especially for the price. The durability is my main issue I dropped the phone once onto a wood floor from about 12 inches and the screen cracked after having it for about 2 weeks. Otherwise it seemed to be a decent phone. It had a few little quirks that took a little getting used to but otherwise I think it wood be a good phone if it was more durable.
OUTPUT: neutral

INPUT: Too stiff, barely zips, and is very bulky
OUTPUT: negative

INPUT: I love how the waist doesn&#39;t have an elastic band in them. I have a bad back and tight waist bands always make my back feel worse.These feel decent...although If they could make them just one size larger..and not just offer plus size....that would be even better for my back.
OUTPUT: positive

INPUT: It will do the job of holding shoes. It&#39;s not glamorous, but it holds shoes and stands in a closet. You will need help with the shelving assembly as it is a two person job.
OUTPUT: neutral

INPUT: All the pockets and functionality are just right. I can&#39;t really find anything about the usability that annoys me such as pockets or organization not quite right. The pockets are placed and sized well and I find them all useful. The most annoying thing about it is that it does not stand up straight on its own, however, it has a very predictable side that it falls to. It leans predictably so it is not an actual issue against it&#39;s overall usability.

OUTPUT: positive

INPUT: Fantastic belt ,love it . This is my second one , the first one was a little small but this one is perfect. I suggest you order one size bigger than your waist size.
OUTPUT: negative

INPUT: This shirt is not long as the picture indicates. It&#39;s just below waist length. Disappointed b/c I am 5&#39;10 and wanted to wear with leggings.
OUTPUT: negative

INPUT: The black one with the tassels on the front and it looks pretty cute, perfect for summer. I have broad shoulders so the looseness was great for me but if you are more petit you might not love how oversized it can look (specially the sleeves). Please note, it does SHRINK after washing (not even drying) so beware!! Also, it is very short but cute nonetheless.
OUTPUT: neutral

INPUT: It was recommended by a friend and found that things are really good to wear and I like them very much.
OUTPUT: positive

INPUT: Nice lightweight material without being cheap feeling. Generally the design is nice, except the waist. The sewn in waist band is high. If you are long waisted , it would be way above your waist. I am a medium which is what I ordered. The waistband is about at the last rib in the front. When you tie the attached belt there is an improvement. OK as a house dress for me. I&#39;m 5&#39;4&#34; and it&#39;s bit bit long. I just knotted the corners of the bottom hem...that works.

This is the worst piece of garbage I have bought from Amazon in years, save your money and go somewhere else!!
OUTPUT: negative

INPUT: very cute style and design, but tarnished after 1 wear!

INPUT: For the money, it&#39;s a good buy... but the fingerprint ID just doesn&#39;t work very good. After several attempts, it would not allow me to register my fingerprint. So... I just use the key to lock and unlock the safe, and that&#39;s not a problem. If you want something with the ability to open with your fingerprint, you&#39;ll need to spend a bit more, but if fingerprint id isn&#39;t something you absolutely need to have, then this safe is for you.

Not happy with this product, tried to return, however these markets are an unreturnable item.

INPUT: Wore it when I went to the bar a couple times and the silver coating started to rub off but for the price I cannot complain. My biggest issue I have with it is it flipping around. Got a lot of compliments though.
OUTPUT: neutral

INPUT: Very poorly packaged. The glasses banged each other. Should have been bubble wrapped. So bummed that I can‚Äôt use these for a party tonight!
OUTPUT: negative

INPUT: Half of the pads were dried out. The others worked great!
OUTPUT: neutral

INPUT: I&#39;ve been using this product with my laundry for a while now and I like it, but I had to return it because it wasn&#39;t packaged right and everything was damaged.
OUTPUT: negative

INPUT: The clear backing lacks the stickiness to keep the letters adhered until you‚Äôre finished weeding! It‚Äôs so frustrating to have to keep up with a bunch of letters and pieces that have curled and fell off the paper! It requires additional work to make sure that they‚Äôre aligned properly and being applied on the right side, which was an issue for me several times! I purchased 3 packs of this and while it‚Äôs okay for larger designs, it sucks for lettering or anything intricate üòè Possibly it‚Äôs old and dried out, but in any event, I will not be buying from this vendor again and suggest that you don‚Äôt either!
OUTPUT: negative

INPUT: Ordered two identical rolls. One arrived with the vacuum bag having a large hole poked in the center - almost the size of the center hub hole. Since the roll arrives in a product box the hole either occurred before boxing at the manufacturer or I received a return. The seller responded promptly and asked for photos, which I provided. Then they asked if there was anything wrong with the product. Huh? I replied it has some issues (likely moisture related). Then they asked for details of issues. Huh? Well, I&#39;ve had enough of providing them details of the damaged/defective product.
OUTPUT: neutral

INPUT: The product is fine and the delivery was fast, but there&#39;s no way to seal the package once it&#39;s opened. There&#39;s a wide piece of tape, but you have to cut the package open to get into it unlike most wipes that have a slit with an adhesive to cover it afterward. If you don&#39;t seal them back up they go dry and are useless.

OUTPUT: positive

INPUT: Really cute outfit and fit well. But, the two bows fell off the top the first time worn. The bows were glued on opposed to sewn.
OUTPUT: neutral

INPUT: As a hard shell jacket, it‚Äôs pretty good. I ordered the extra large for a skiing trip. It comes small so order a size bigger then normal. I can not use the fleece liner because it is too small. The hard shell is not water proof. I live in the Pacific Northwest and this is not enough to keep you dry. I really like the look of this jacket too.
OUTPUT: neutral

INPUT: Perfect brush, small radius, and good quality.

INPUT: Overall I liked the phone especially for the price. The durability is my main issue I dropped the phone once onto a wood floor from about 12 inches and the screen cracked after having it for about 2 weeks. Otherwise it seemed to be a decent phone. It had a few little quirks that took a little getting used to but otherwise I think it wood be a good phone if it was more durable.

INPUT: For the S3 Gold: Color matches perfectly, but the band I received is not the same quality as the other BRG bands I‚Äôve bought. The middle metal clasp that attaches to the watch is extremely loose. The entire clasp that slides into the watch is also loose and wiggles. The magnetic clasp to lock the bracelet in place also slides off easily. I love that the color matches, but I either got a defective band or the quality has gone down.
OUTPUT: negative

INPUT: This item appears to be the same as one I purchased from a local hardware store a year or so ago, but it is not finished or burnished to the quality of the one I previously purchased. As such it looks dull, but not exceedingly so. It is close enough to be acceptable.
OUTPUT: neutral

INPUT: Worst iPhone charger ever. The charger head broke after used for 5 Times. Terrible quality.
OUTPUT: negative

INPUT: few cables not working, please reply what to do?
OUTPUT: neutral

INPUT: This cable is not of very good quality. It doesn‚Äôt fit right so you have to hold the connector to the port in order to work.
OUTPUT: negative

INPUT: Not enough information and it seems to behave erratically. Not contacted Tech Support yet. Support URL in printed instructions is dead. Needs better instructions for VOIP POTS without cordless phones in home. I am somewhat allergic to radios. Literature does not tell what to expect when CPR Call blocker is disconnected for short period of time. It depends entirely on talk line battery. I need it to work and am not giving up. Tech support seems to be illusive.
OUTPUT: neutral

INPUT: Had some problems getting it to work. The supplied cable was no good - would not charge the battery. When I replaced cable with my own was able to charge and then connect the device via bluetooth to a PC. Had trouble finding the PC software but when I emailed their support they responded within a day with the correct download info. PC program works well for testing the unit after you figure out which port to use (port 4 in my case). The accuracy and stability of the unit look very good for my application, however I was not able to connect to either an iPhone or iPad (tried several of each) via bluetooth. Will have to hard-wire if I decide to use this device in my product.
OUTPUT: neutral

INPUT: Worst cable I have had to date for my iphone. It&#39;s so stiff if you move it at all while plugged in, it disconnects. I have to carefully plug it in all the way and it doesn&#39;t give that really solid click feel, then if disturbed at all it loses connection. I have another Anker Powerline 1 cable and it has been great. Not sure how the II can go backwards. My window to return has closed so I guess I&#39;ll contact them directly and see if they will replace with a different cable.

INPUT: I bought this modem/router about two years ago. At the start it seemed to be ok but for the last year plus I‚Äôve had problems with it dropping the internet. This happens on all my devices both Wi-Fi and wired. The only way to restore service was to do a AC power reset. This was happening once or twice a day. Comcast came out, ran a new coax line from the pedestal to the house and boosted the signal level. Same problem. The Arris Tech guys were great but could not solve the problem. Additionally, I lost the 5G service on three occasions. I had to do a factory reset to restore this. I cannot recommend this modem/router based upon my experiences. I purchased a Netgear AC1900 modem/router. It‚Äôs fantastic. I‚Äôv Had it for over a week with no problems. It‚Äôs faster and the range is greater than the Arris. I read online that other people have had problems with the Arris modem/router connected to Comcast. If you have Comcast internet I do not recommend this Arris modem/router. Get the Netgear, its much more reliable.
OUTPUT: negative

INPUT: The case and disc were clean when I got them. No cracks to the case and the game worked as needed. The game itself is wonderful, full of adventure. There isn&#39;t much in replay value per se, yet most of the players find themselves going back for more, if only to level up their characters.

INPUT: I did a lot of thinking as I read this book. I felt as though I could really picture what the main character was going through. The author did a great job describing the situations and events. I really rooted for the main character and felt her struggles. It seems as though she had to over come a lot to once again over come a lot. She had a group of interesting characters both supporting her and also ones who were against her. Not a plot to be predicted. I highly recommend this book.

INPUT: I did a lot of thinking as I read this book. I felt as though I could really picture what the main character was going through. The author did a great job describing the situations and events. I really rooted for the main character and felt her struggles. It seems as though she had to over come a lot to once again over come a lot. She had a group of interesting characters both supporting her and also ones who were against her. Not a plot to be predicted. I highly recommend this book. It grabbed my attention from the first page and had me thinking about it long after. I look forward to reading the author&#39;s next book.
OUTPUT: positive

INPUT: Challenging. Love the fact that each session extends into 6 more days of devotional study. We are focusing each study for a 2 week period. Awesome focus point for personal growth as building meaningful relationships within our group. Thank you !

INPUT: I bought these for a replacement for the original band that broke. Fits perfectly with no issues.
OUTPUT: positive

INPUT: The small cover didn‚Äôt seem to work very well. I don‚Äôt feel that they do Avery good job from keeping the avocado from turning brown
OUTPUT: neutral

INPUT: Ordered this for a Santa present and Christmas Eve noticed it came broken!
OUTPUT: negative

INPUT: my problem with the product is the fit. I have a large head and it is too tight everywhere and the neck just doesnt feel right. I want to pull it down but then my nose has no room. I can&#39;t use it because of the poor fit.
OUTPUT: negative

INPUT: This case is ok, but not exceptional - a 3.5 or 4 max. The issue is there are fewer cases available for the Tab A 10.1 w S pen. Of those the Gumdrop is about the best, but it has some serious issues. The case rubber (silicone, whatever) is very smooth and slick, and doesn&#39;t give you a lot of confidence when hold the Tab with one hand. The Tab A is heavy so if your laying down watching a video the case slips in your hand so you have to make frequent adjustments. I had to remove the clear plastic shield that covers the screen because it impaired the touch screen operation. This affected the strength of the 1-piece plastic frame the surrounds the Tab A, so now the rubber outer cover feels really flexible and flimsy. Lastly, they made it difficult to get to the S pen. The S pen is in the back bottom right hand corner of the Tab A, and they made the little rubber flap that protects corner swing backwards for access to the S pen. This means in order to get the S pen out, the flap has to swing out 180 degrees. This is really awkward and hard to do with one hand. This case does a good job protecting my Tab A, but with these serious design flaws I can&#39;t recommend it unless you have an S pen, then you don&#39;t have much choice.

INPUT: I am returning product, I‚Äôve been getting the same Wella Brilliance shampoo for years...the darker and cheaper one circled, and the last Two deliveries were the lighter bottle which smells nothing like the product I want and have been using for nearly 10 years. Extremely dissatisfied, why would they have two products and two prices and send the one you DONT PICK????
OUTPUT: negative

INPUT: These rings are dainty &amp; adorable! Can be worn alone or stacked. The craftsmanship put into these rings, is very evident! I will definitely be buying more!!
OUTPUT: positive

INPUT: my expectations were low for a cheap scale. they were not met, scale doesnt work. popped the cover off the back to put a battery in and the wires were cut and damaged. wouldn&#39;t even turn on. sending it back. product is flimsy and cheap, spend 20 extra bucks on a better brand or scale.
OUTPUT: negative

INPUT: For the S3 Gold: Color matches perfectly, but the band I received is not the same quality as the other BRG bands I‚Äôve bought. The middle metal clasp that attaches to the watch is extremely loose. The entire clasp that slides into the watch is also loose and wiggles. The magnetic clasp to lock the bracelet in place also slides off easily. I love that the color matches, but I either got a defective band or the quality has gone down.
OUTPUT: negative

INPUT: You want an HONEST answer? I just returned from UPS where I returned the FARCE of an earring set to Amazon. It did NOT look like what I saw on Amazon. Only a baby would be able to wear the size of the earring. They were SO small. the size of a pin head I at first thought Amazon had forgotten to enclose them in the bag! I didn&#39;t bother to take them out of the bag and you can have them back. Will NEVER order another thing from your company. A disgrace. Honest enough for you? Grandma
OUTPUT: negative

INPUT: When you order a product, you expect the product to be as described. They were advertised as CAP Dumbbells. However, the product received was Golds Gym dumbbells. If I wanted Golds Gym, I would have bought these from Walmart. I have a complete set of CAP dumbbells, with the exception of my one set from Golds Gym. Is the weight correct, yes. Due they perform, yes. I just expect to get what I paid for not something else. After reading a few other reviews, I see that others have had the same issue.

It gives so much interesting context, it may be overly insightful. For the person who must know everything, this is great. For the person who has no idea. Googling will suffice.

OUTPUT: negative

INPUT: I saw this and thought it would be good to store the myriad of batts that I have. You must know that this is made to hang on the wall. The lid does not lock down in any way it just hangs lose and bangs into the Size C batts. You can lay it flat but remember the lid does not in any way hold the batteries from falling out if you turn it to the side, Now for me the biggest disappointment is that there are no slots for the batteries that use the most, the CR 123 batts. I rate it just barely useful. I should have read more carefully the description. It is too much trouble to return it so I&#39;ll keep it and buy smaller cases with locking lids

We need to expect truth from those in the political arena or elect those people that will speak the truth. You don&#39;t want your friends to lie, why accept it from elected officials. Apathy is running rampant. We need to be able to discern truth and it can only be found if we are willing to look for it. Check things out, don&#39;t always take what someone says as truth. A short, but powerful, book.

It was cool inside of shelter especially if you put some water on the top of the shelter. It is also very easy to carry and set up. It is a good product with high quality.
OUTPUT: positive

INPUT: These are very fragile. I have a cat who is a bit rambunctious and sometimes knocks my phone off my nightstand while it&#39;s plugged in. He managed to break all of these the first or second time he did that. I&#39;m sure they&#39;re fine if you&#39;re very careful with them, but if whatever you&#39;re charging falls off a table or nightstand while plugged in, these are very likely to stop working quickly.

INPUT: The book is very informative, with great tips and tricks about how to travel as well as what the locations are about which is both it&#39;s good and bad aspect. It gives so much interesting context, it may be overly insightful. For the person who must know everything, this is great. For the person who has no idea. Googling will suffice.
OUTPUT: neutral

INPUT: I like this series. The main characters are unusual and very damaged from a terrible childhood. Will is an excellent investigator but due to a disability he believes he is illiterate. Slaughter does a very good job showing how people with dyslexia learn ways to hide their limitations. It will be interesting to see how these characters play out in the future. I understand that Slaughter brings some of the characters from the Grant County series to this series. The crimes are brutal. I&#39;m sure this is a good representation of what police come across in their career. The procedural is well done and kept me interested from start to finish. I&#39;m looking forward to reading more of this series soon.
OUTPUT: positive

I liked the adult hat but it is not sold separately. The seller was rude and unhelpful when I contacted them directly through Amazon. The faux fur pom was either already torn or tore when I was trying on the hat. See the attached photograph. The pom came aprt, exposing the inner fluff.

INPUT: Looking at orher reviews the tail was supposed to be obscenely long -- it was actually the perfect size but im not sure if thats intentional. The waist strap fits perfectly-- but again, need to list that my waist is fairly wide and it sat on my hips. Im unsure about the life of the strap. To the actual quality the fur seems of a fair (not great but not terrible quality but the tail isnt fully stuffed.) Apparently theres supposed to be a wire to pose the tail. There is none in mine, which is fine cause again, mine came up shorter than others. Im only rating 3 stars because of some unintentional good things.

It doesn‚Äôt stretch, it‚Äôs not breathable and it is very small and uncomfortable! It even seems it‚Äôs stitched differently so that it coveres 50% less of my head. So disappointing!!

INPUT: You want an HONEST answer? I just returned from UPS where I returned the FARCE of an earring set to Amazon. It did NOT look like what I saw on Amazon. Only a baby would be able to wear the size of the earring. They were SO small. the size of a pin head I at first thought Amazon had forgotten to enclose them in the bag!

INPUT: Ordered two identical rolls. One arrived with the vacuum bag having a large hole poked in the center - almost the size of the center hub hole. Since the roll arrives in a product box the hole either occurred before boxing at the manufacturer or I received a return. The seller responded promptly and asked for photos, which I provided. Then they asked if there was anything wrong with the product. Huh? I replied it has some issues (likely moisture related). Then they asked for details of issues. Huh? Well, I&#39;ve had enough of providing them details of the damaged/defective product.
OUTPUT: neutral

INPUT: Not super durable. The bag holds up okay but the drawstrings sometimes tear if the bag gets past a couple lbs.

OUTPUT: positive

INPUT: it does not work, only one hearing aid works at a time
OUTPUT: negative

INPUT: Had some problems getting it to work. The supplied cable was no good - would not charge the battery. When I replaced cable with my own was able to charge and then connect the device via bluetooth to a PC. Had trouble finding the PC software but when I emailed their support they responded within a day with the correct download info. PC program works well for testing the unit after you figure out which port to use (port 4 in my case). The accuracy and stability of the unit look very good for my application, however I was not able to connect to either an iPhone or iPad (tried several of each) via bluetooth. Will have to hard-wire if I decide to use this device in my product.
OUTPUT: neutral

INPUT: These are very fragile. I have a cat who is a bit rambunctious and sometimes knocks my phone off my nightstand while it&#39;s plugged in. He managed to break all of these the first or second time he did that. I&#39;m sure they&#39;re fine if you&#39;re very careful with them, but if whatever you&#39;re charging falls off a table or nightstand while plugged in, these are very likely to stop working quickly.
OUTPUT: negative

INPUT: One of them worked, the other one didn&#39;t. There&#39;s no apparent damage, it just won&#39;t work on multiple phones and with multiple wall ports.

INPUT: Not worth it the data cable had to move it in a certain position to make it work i just returned it back.
OUTPUT: negative

INPUT: Overall I liked the phone especially for the price. The durability is my main issue I dropped the phone once onto a wood floor from about 12 inches and the screen cracked after having it for about 2 weeks. Otherwise it seemed to be a decent phone. It had a few little quirks that took a little getting used to but otherwise I think it wood be a good phone if it was more durable.

INPUT: These are great for SO many things. Originally I had them in my drink at a club but then later bought them for my wedding center pieces.

Great customer service!
OUTPUT: positive

INPUT: Absolutely terrible. I ordered these expecting a quality product for 10 dollars. They were shipped in an envelope inside of another envelope all just banging against each other while on their way to me from the seller. 3 of them are broken internally, they make a rattle noise as the ones that work do not. I will be requesting a refund for these and filing a complaint with Amazon. Don&#39;t purchase unless you like to buy broken/damaged goods. Completely worthless.
OUTPUT: negative

INPUT: Maybe it&#39;s just my luck because this seems to happen to me with other products but the motor broke in 2 weeks. That was a bummer. I liked it for the 2 weeks though!
OUTPUT: neutral

It has notches - supposedly to allow you to twist it onto the nightlight base. You‚Äôd need to be able to do that in order to replace the bulb.

They&#39;re super durable and easy to clean, great for people with sensitive skin or who have allergies. These are soft, hypoallergenic, and super absorbent without feeling like wearing a diaper or something (at least, that&#39;s how I used to feel wearing pads).

INPUT: Glass is extremely thin. Mine broke into a million shards. Very dangerous!
OUTPUT: neutral

INPUT: Ordered this for a Santa present and Christmas Eve noticed it came broken!
OUTPUT: negative

INPUT: Very poorly packaged. The glasses banged each other. Should have been bubble wrapped. So bummed that I can‚Äôt use these for a party tonight!
OUTPUT: negative

INPUT: So pretty...but the first time I unplugged it, the glass top came off of the base. There‚Äôs a plastic ring attached to the bottom of the glass part. It has notches - supposedly to allow you to twist it onto the nightlight base. You‚Äôd need to be able to do that in order to replace the bulb. I‚Äôll try gorilla glue or something to see if the ring can be securely affixed to the glass. Surprisingly poor design for something so beautiful.
OUTPUT: negative

INPUT: DISAPPOINTED! Owl arrived missing stone for the right eye. Supposed to be a gift.
OUTPUT: neutral

INPUT: Glass was broken had to ship it back waiting on the new one to be here tomorrow hopefully not not broken.

INPUT: I opened a bottle of this smart water and took a large drink, it had a very strong disgusting taste (swamp water). I looked into the bottle and found many small particles were floating in the water... a few brown specs and some translucent white. I am completely freaked out and have contacted Coca-Cola, the product manufacture.
OUTPUT: negative

INPUT: these were ok, but to big for the craft I needed them for. Maybe find something to use them on.
OUTPUT: neutral

INPUT: Cute, soft and great for a baby that‚Äôs 1 and loves Bubble Guppies.
OUTPUT: positive

INPUT: There was some question on as to whether or not these were solid stainless steel or not on the listing. Since the seller made a point of saying they were solid, I decided to give it a shot. The bad news: my grill was 1/2&#34; too wide, so I had to saw off the nubs on the end of the grates to fit. The good news: they are definitely solid stainless as advertised, so I am not worried about these grates de-laminating like my old factory grates. Glad I bought these. They look great, well-constructed and feel heavy duty. Can&#39;t wait to fire up the grill!
OUTPUT: positive

INPUT: Okay pool cue. However you can buy one 4 oz. lighter (21 oz,) for 1/3 the price of this 25 oz. cue. Not worth the extra money for the weight difference.
OUTPUT: neutral

INPUT: Loved that they were dishwasher safe and so colorful. Unfortunately they are not airtight so unsuitable for carbonated water. I just bought a soda stream and needed bottles for the water. It lost its carbonation ‚òπÔ∏è

INPUT: The 8 year old nephew said he wanted this for his birthday. I felt it was a bit much for a toy but he caught me on a good day. Come to find out it&#39;s a fragile collectible so the nephew lost all the small parts the moment he opened it. I guess it&#39;s adequate for collectors that want detail on such a small figurine.
OUTPUT: neutral

OUTPUT: neutral

INPUT: Our family does a game night most weeks and I got this thinking it would be fun to play. And it was. We played it 3 times (2 adults and 2 kids, 11 and 10) before we figured out how to win every time. Even the &#34;more challenging&#34; level is just more flooding, which, once solved, isn&#39;t much of a challenge. I was hoping for re-playability, but we&#39;ve taken this one out of the rotation. Fun and interesting the first couple of times through, though.

OUTPUT: positive

INPUT: The clear backing lacks the stickiness to keep the letters adhered until you‚Äôre finished weeding! It‚Äôs so frustrating to have to keep up with a bunch of letters and pieces that have curled and fell off the paper! It requires additional work to make sure that they‚Äôre aligned properly and being applied on the right side, which was an issue for me several times! I purchased 3 packs of this and while it‚Äôs okay for larger designs, it sucks for lettering or anything intricate üòè Possibly it‚Äôs old and dried out, but in any event, I will not be buying from this vendor again and suggest that you don‚Äôt either!
OUTPUT: negative

INPUT: I did a lot of thinking as I read this book. I felt as though I could really picture what the main character was going through. The author did a great job describing the situations and events. I really rooted for the main character and felt her struggles. It seems as though she had to over come a lot to once again over come a lot. She had a group of interesting characters both supporting her and also ones who were against her. Not a plot to be predicted. I highly recommend this book. It grabbed my attention from the first page and had me thinking about it long after. I look forward to reading the author&#39;s next book.

INPUT: 3 1/2 Stars Remedy is a brothers best friend romance as well as a second chance romance mixed into one. It&#39;s a unique story, and the hero (Grady) has to do everything to get Collins back and prove he&#39;s the guy for her. Three years ago, Grady and Collins had an amazing night together. Collins thought she was finally getting everything she dreamed of, her brothers best friend... but when she woke up alone the next morning, and never heard from her, things definitely changed. Now Grady is back, and he&#39;s not leaving, and he&#39;s doing everything in his power to prove to her why he left, and that he&#39;s not giving her up this time around. While I loved the premise of this story, and at times Grady, he really got on my nerves. I totally understand his reasoning for leaving that night, but to not even send a letter to Collins explaining himself? To leave her wondering and hurt for all those years, and then expect her to welcome him back with open arms? Was he delusional?! Collins was right to be upset, angry, hurt, etc. She was right to put up a fight with him when he wanted her back and to move forward. I admire her will power, because Grady was persistent. I loved Collins in this book, she was strong, and she guarded her heart, and I admired her for that. Sure she loved Grady, but she was scared, and hesitant to let him back in her life, who wouldn&#39;t be after what he did to her? Her character was definitely my favorite out of the two. She definitely let things go at the pace she wanted, and when she was ready to listen, she listened. There is a lot of angst in this book, and I did enjoy watching these two reconnect when Collins started to forgive Grady, I just wish Grady would have not come off as so whiney and would have been a little more understanding. He kept saying he understood, but at times he was a little too pushy to me, and then he was sweet towards the end. I ended up loving him just as much as Collins, but in the beginning of the book, I had a hard time reading his points of view because I couldn&#39;t connect with his character. The first part of this book, was not my favorite, but he second part? I adored, hence my rating. If you like second chance, and brothers best friend romances, you may really enjoy this book, I just had a hard time with Grady at first and how he handled some of the things he did.
OUTPUT: neutral

INPUT: This book was okay I guess. I was not really fond of Jaime&#39;s views on things but oh well. Quinn was a wise cracker, but otherwise okay. Jaime should have set her parents down when she was younger and told them both they were messing up her life, maybe she wouldn&#39;t have been so messed up. Otherwise it was okay book.

I&#39;ll never know because he won&#39;t eat them. At first I gave them to him as a treat. He sniffed it and walked away. I crumbled just one up in his food but he was onto me and wouldn&#39;t touch it. So, sadly, the search continues.

INPUT: I hate to give this product one star when it probably deserves 5. My dog has chronic itchy skin and I had high hopes that this product would be the answer to his skin issues. I&#39;ll never know because he won&#39;t eat them. At first I gave them to him as a treat. He sniffed it and walked away. I crumbled just one up in his food but he was onto me and wouldn&#39;t touch it. So, sadly, the search continues.
OUTPUT: negative

INPUT: Just doesn&#39;t get hot enough for my liking. Its stashed away in the drawer.
OUTPUT: neutral

INPUT: I ordered Copic Bold Primaries and got Copic Ciao Rainbow instead. Amazon gave me a full refund but still annoying to have to reorder and hopefully get the right item.
OUTPUT: negative

INPUT: These picks are super cute but 1/2 of them were broken. When I tried to replace the item, there was no option for it.

OUTPUT: neutral

INPUT: Very good price for a nice quality bracelet. My sister loved her birthday present! She wears it everyday.
OUTPUT: positive

INPUT: Mediocre all around. Durability is &#34;meh&#34;. Find a good (modular) set that will last you 10x the durability. This isn&#39;t the cheap Chinese headphones you have been looking for. Look for IEM
OUTPUT: neutral

INPUT: For a fitness tracker it is adequate. Heart rate monitor works ok. I feel it has missed steps in my everyday walking but if you start the monitor for fitness then it does well. If you hold anything in the arm with the tracker and cant move your arm it counts nothing. Battery life on the tracker is amazing. It lasts 7 to 8 days on a charge. It charges very fast. The wrist band is not very comfortable. Do to the way it charges i am not sure you can switch bands. I have not looked into this.

INPUT: Looks good. Clasp some times does not lock completely and the watch falls off. One time it fell off and the back cover popped off. I do get lots of compliments of color combination.
OUTPUT: neutral

INPUT: The clear backing lacks the stickiness to keep the letters adhered until you‚Äôre finished weeding! It‚Äôs so frustrating to have to keep up with a bunch of letters and pieces that have curled and fell off the paper! It requires additional work to make sure that they‚Äôre aligned properly and being applied on the right side, which was an issue for me several times! I purchased 3 packs of this and while it‚Äôs okay for larger designs, it sucks for lettering or anything intricate üòè Possibly it‚Äôs old and dried out, but in any event, I will not be buying from this vendor again and suggest that you don‚Äôt either!
OUTPUT: negative

INPUT: I like these storage bins overall. The color of the lining inside wasn‚Äôt expected, it shows a light brown color in the photo but it‚Äôs pretty dark. I would have preferred the lining inside to match the outside, tan or grey. Other than that they are cute and look as pictured.

OUTPUT: negative

INPUT: These are very fragile. I have a cat who is a bit rambunctious and sometimes knocks my phone off my nightstand while it&#39;s plugged in. He managed to break all of these the first or second time he did that. I&#39;m sure they&#39;re fine if you&#39;re very careful with them, but if whatever you&#39;re charging falls off a table or nightstand while plugged in, these are very likely to stop working quickly.

OUTPUT: neutral

INPUT: Absolutely terrible. I ordered these expecting a quality product for 10 dollars. They were shipped in an envelope inside of another envelope all just banging against each other while on their way to me from the seller. 3 of them are broken internally, they make a rattle noise as the ones that work do not. I will be requesting a refund for these and filing a complaint with Amazon. Don&#39;t purchase unless you like to buy broken/damaged goods. Completely worthless.

INPUT: I got this backpack Monday night and I was excited about it because I had seen many great reviews for it. I used it for the first time the next day to hold a fair amount of things, and while I was out I noticed this huge rip right down the middle that wasn&#39;t there before. I would have been more understanding if I had it for a few months but this was the first time I had put anything into it. I&#39;ve never been more disappointed in a product before as I have with this backpack. Be very careful when considering purchasing this product.

INPUT: Quality made from a family business. Sometimes a challenge to move around due to the chew toys hanging off but gives our puppy something to knaw on throughout the night. 5 month update: Our dog doesn&#39;t destroy many toys but since he truly loves this one he has ripped off the head, the tail rope, torn a few corner rope rings, put teeth marks in the internal foam and now ripped the underside of the cover. I&#39;m giving this 4 stars still due to the simple fact that he LOVES this thing. Purchased right before they sold out, maybe the new model is more durable. Update with new model: The newer model has some areas where design has decreased in quality. The &#34;tail&#34; rope is not attached nearly as well as the first one. However, so far nothing has been ripped off of it in the 3 weeks since we have received it. He still loves it though!

INPUT: The iron works good, but its very small, almost delicate. The insulation parts on the tip were plastic not ceramic. Came with the plug that&#39;s a bonus. But it took quite a bit longer then most things on amazon to ship. I use it for soldering race drones, i ordered the smaller tip, and its actually to small for all but my micro drones. Had to order another tip. Gets hot pretty quick. Apparently this is a firmware upgrade you can do to make it better, but i didn&#39;t have to use it.
OUTPUT: neutral

INPUT: I like this product, make me feel comfortable. I can use it convenient. The price is very cheap.
OUTPUT: positive

INPUT: I initially was impressed by the material quality of the headphones, but as I connected the headphones to listen to my song there was a problem. There is constantly this weird &#34;old cable tv that has lost it&#39;s signal sound&#34; in the background when trying to listen to anything. Pretty disappointed.
OUTPUT: neutral

INPUT: This cable is not of very good quality. It doesn‚Äôt fit right so you have to hold the connector to the port in order to work.
OUTPUT: negative

INPUT: I loved this adapter. Arrived on time and material used was good quality. It works great, this is convenient when I use this in my car, it can use headset when you charging. It is a very good product!

Ive used several different external mics and the audio always ends up being unusable. I really wish I would&#39;ve researched this camera some more before buying it. Man what a waste of money.

OUTPUT: positive

INPUT: Very cheap a dollar store item and u can not sweep all material into pan as the edge is not beveled correctly
OUTPUT: negative

INPUT: I love the glass design and the shape is comfortable in one hand. My first purchase of this kettle lasted for two years of daily use. The hinge on the lid is fragile, and since the lid doesn&#39;t flip entirely back - it gets strained and broke within the year. Everything else worked fine until the auto shut-off stopped working after two years. For safety, I bought a new one which has now stopped working entirely after 17 months. I still love the design, but for $58 I expected it to last longer.
OUTPUT: neutral

INPUT: I like these storage bins overall. The color of the lining inside wasn‚Äôt expected, it shows a light brown color in the photo but it‚Äôs pretty dark. I would have preferred the lining inside to match the outside, tan or grey. Other than that they are cute and look as pictured.
OUTPUT: neutral

INPUT: I found this stable and very helpful to get things off the floor, as well as to be able to store below and on top of. Nice that it&#39;s adjustable.
OUTPUT: positive

INPUT: Excellent workmanship, beautiful appearance, and just the right size, installation is simple, special and stable. It can put a lot of things such as the usual utensils, dishes, and cups however, the biggest advantage is that it can save space.

INPUT: Absolutely terrible. I ordered these expecting a quality product for 10 dollars. They were shipped in an envelope inside of another envelope all just banging against each other while on their way to me from the seller. 3 of them are broken internally, they make a rattle noise as the ones that work do not. I will be requesting a refund for these and filing a complaint with Amazon. Don&#39;t purchase unless you like to buy broken/damaged goods. Completely worthless.
OUTPUT: negative

INPUT: I never received the item, it was said to arrive late for about 10 days, and yet not arrived.

INPUT: Didn&#39;t expect much for the price, and that&#39;s about what I got. It covers and protects my table, just have to live with a grid of folds from packaging. Seller advised to use a hair dryer to flatten out the wrinkles, but it was a very painstakingly slow process that only took some of the sharp edges off of the folds, didn&#39;t make much difference. Going to invest in something better (and much more expensive) for daily use, this is OK for what it does.
OUTPUT: neutral

INPUT: These little lights are awesome. They put off a nice amount of light. And you can put them ANYWHERE! I have put one in the pantry. Another in my linen closet. Another one right next to my bed for when I get up in the middle of the night. Have only had them about a month but so far so good!
OUTPUT: positive

INPUT: We bring the kid to Cape Cod this long weekend. The shelter is very helpful when we stay on the beach. Kid feel comfortable when she was in the shelter. It was cool inside of shelter especially if you put some water on the top of the shelter. It is also very easy to carry and set up. It is a good product with high quality.

INPUT: These are great for SO many things. Originally I had them in my drink at a club but then later bought them for my wedding center pieces. The light stays on for weeks but becomes dim after 3 or 4 days. We had a great time leaving the extra ones around the party and will use the extra ones for fun.
OUTPUT: positive

INPUT: Says it&#39;s charging but actually drains battery. Do not buy not worth the money.
OUTPUT: negative

INPUT: Does not give out that much light
OUTPUT: neutral

INPUT: I have this installed under my spa cover to help maintain the heat. My spa is fully electric (including the heater), and this has done a good job reducing my overall electric bill by about 15% - 20% each month since last November. Quality is holding up fine, but it&#39;s out of the sun since it&#39;s under the spa cover. (Sorry, can&#39;t comment on what the longevity would be in the full sun.)
OUTPUT: positive

INPUT: So pretty...but the first time I unplugged it, the glass top came off of the base. There‚Äôs a plastic ring attached to the bottom of the glass part. It has notches - supposedly to allow you to twist it onto the nightlight base. You‚Äôd need to be able to do that in order to replace the bulb. I‚Äôll try gorilla glue or something to see if the ring can be securely affixed to the glass. Surprisingly poor design for something so beautiful.

INPUT: These do run large than expected. I wear a size 6 ordered 5-6 and they are way to big, I have to wear socks to keep them on . Plus I thought they would be thicker inside but after wearing them for a few days they seemed to break down . I will try to find a better pair
OUTPUT: neutral

INPUT: I have bought these cloths in the past, but never from Amazon. In contrast to previous purchases, these cloths do not absorb properly after the first wash. After washing they feel more like &#39;napkins&#39;... very disappointed.
OUTPUT: negative

INPUT: I love how the waist doesn&#39;t have an elastic band in them. I have a bad back and tight waist bands always make my back feel worse.These feel decent...although If they could make them just one size larger..and not just offer plus size....that would be even better for my back.

INPUT: The black one with the tassels on the front and it looks pretty cute, perfect for summer. I have broad shoulders so the looseness was great for me but if you are more petit you might not love how oversized it can look (specially the sleeves). Please note, it does SHRINK after washing (not even drying) so beware!! Also, it is very short but cute nonetheless.
OUTPUT: neutral

INPUT: I think I got a size too big and their are weird wrinkling at the thigh area. I got them bigger to be appropriate for casual work or church social occasions without fitting too tight. The color was nice and the pair I have are soft. I will try washing them in hot water to see if they shrink a little.

OUTPUT: positive

INPUT: Upsetting...these only work if you have a thin phone and or no phone case at all. I&#39;m not going to take my phone&#39;s case (which isn&#39;t thick) off Everytime I want to use the stand. Wast of money. Don&#39;t buy if you use a phone case to protect your phone it&#39;s too thin.
OUTPUT: negative

INPUT: This is a knock off product. This IS NOT a puddle jumper brand float but a flimsy knock off instead. It is missing all stearns and puddle jumper branding on the arms. Do not buy!
OUTPUT: negative

INPUT: This case is ok, but not exceptional - a 3.5 or 4 max. The issue is there are fewer cases available for the Tab A 10.1 w S pen. Of those the Gumdrop is about the best, but it has some serious issues. The case rubber (silicone, whatever) is very smooth and slick, and doesn&#39;t give you a lot of confidence when hold the Tab with one hand. The Tab A is heavy so if your laying down watching a video the case slips in your hand so you have to make frequent adjustments. I had to remove the clear plastic shield that covers the screen because it impaired the touch screen operation. This affected the strength of the 1-piece plastic frame the surrounds the Tab A, so now the rubber outer cover feels really flexible and flimsy. Lastly, they made it difficult to get to the S pen. The S pen is in the back bottom right hand corner of the Tab A, and they made the little rubber flap that protects corner swing backwards for access to the S pen. This means in order to get the S pen out, the flap has to swing out 180 degrees. This is really awkward and hard to do with one hand. This case does a good job protecting my Tab A, but with these serious design flaws I can&#39;t recommend it unless you have an S pen, then you don&#39;t have much choice.
OUTPUT: neutral

INPUT: I found this stable and very helpful to get things off the floor, as well as to be able to store below and on top of. Nice that it&#39;s adjustable.
OUTPUT: positive

INPUT: Great product, I got this for my dad because he tends to drop a lot of objects and when i got him his airpod case, i was worried it might break. This case did the job and the texture made it non slip so it wont fall off surfaces as easily. The clip also makes it easy for my dad to clip it to his work bag so it wont get lost easily.

INPUT: Arrived today and a bit disappointed. Great color and nice backing, BUT not thick and plush for the high price. Except fot the backing, you can find the same thickness at your local Walmart for a lot less money.
OUTPUT: neutral

INPUT: It will do the job of holding shoes. It&#39;s not glamorous, but it holds shoes and stands in a closet. You will need help with the shelving assembly as it is a two person job.
OUTPUT: neutral

INPUT: The dress fits perfect! It‚Äôs a tad too long but not enough to bother with the hassle of getting it hemmed. The material is extremely comfortable and I love the pockets! I WILL be ordering a couple more in different colors.
OUTPUT: positive

INPUT: The beige mat looked orange on my beige flooring so I returned it and ordered a gray mat from another company that was $7 less to be safe on the color.
OUTPUT: neutral

INPUT: great throw for high end sofa, and works with any style even contemporary sleek sectionals
OUTPUT: positive

INPUT: This is a beautiful rug. exactly what I was looking for. When I received it, I was very impressed with the color. However, it is very thin. My dinning room table sets on it so I don&#39;t think it will get much wear. I hope it will hold up over time.

INPUT: My dog loves this toy, I haven&#39;t seen hear more thrill with any other toy, for the first three days, which is how long the squeaker lasted. She is not a heavy chewer, and in one of her &#34;victory walks&#34; after retrieving the ball, the squeaker was already gone. Apart from that it is my best investment
OUTPUT: neutral

INPUT: Ordered this for a Santa present and Christmas Eve noticed it came broken!
OUTPUT: negative

INPUT: My puppies loved it!
OUTPUT: positive

INPUT: The toy is ok but it came in what they call &#34;standard packaging&#34; and that amounted to a plain brown cardboard box, NOT the colorful box in the photo. Can&#39;t give this as a gift in this cardboard packaging.
OUTPUT: neutral

INPUT: Quality made from a family business. Sometimes a challenge to move around due to the chew toys hanging off but gives our puppy something to knaw on throughout the night. 5 month update: Our dog doesn&#39;t destroy many toys but since he truly loves this one he has ripped off the head, the tail rope, torn a few corner rope rings, put teeth marks in the internal foam and now ripped the underside of the cover. I&#39;m giving this 4 stars still due to the simple fact that he LOVES this thing. Purchased right before they sold out, maybe the new model is more durable. Update with new model: The newer model has some areas where design has decreased in quality. The &#34;tail&#34; rope is not attached nearly as well as the first one. However, so far nothing has been ripped off of it in the 3 weeks since we have received it. He still loves it though!
OUTPUT: neutral

INPUT: My dog is loving her new toy. She has torn up others very quick, so far so good here. L

OUTPUT: negative

OUTPUT: negative

INPUT: We bought it in hopes my son would stop sucking his thumb. He doesn&#39;t suck it when it&#39;s on but when it&#39;s off for eating, bathing, washing hands... he will still do it. We are now going to try the nail polish with bitter taste. This is a good idea, my son just needs something stronger to beat it.
OUTPUT: neutral

INPUT: Had three weeks and corner grommet ripped out
OUTPUT: negative

INPUT: The iron works good, but its very small, almost delicate. The insulation parts on the tip were plastic not ceramic. Came with the plug that&#39;s a bonus. But it took quite a bit longer then most things on amazon to ship. I use it for soldering race drones, i ordered the smaller tip, and its actually to small for all but my micro drones. Had to order another tip. Gets hot pretty quick. Apparently this is a firmware upgrade you can do to make it better, but i didn&#39;t have to use it.
OUTPUT: neutral

INPUT: Tip broke after a few weeks of use.

INPUT: Don&#39;t buy this game the physics are terrible and I am so mad at this game because probably there are about 40 hackers on every single game and the game. Don&#39;t doesn&#39;t even do anything about it you know they just let the hackers do whatever they want and then they do know that the game is terrible but they&#39;re doing absolutely nothing about it and the game keeps on doing updates about their characters really what they should be updating is the physics because it&#39;s terrible don&#39;t buy this game the physics are terrible and mechanics are terrible the people that obviously the people that built this game was high or something because it&#39;s one of the worst games I&#39;ve honestly ever played in my life I would rather play Pixel Games in this crap it&#39;s one of the worst games don&#39;t buy
OUTPUT: negative

INPUT: This case is ok, but not exceptional - a 3.5 or 4 max. The issue is there are fewer cases available for the Tab A 10.1 w S pen. Of those the Gumdrop is about the best, but it has some serious issues. The case rubber (silicone, whatever) is very smooth and slick, and doesn&#39;t give you a lot of confidence when hold the Tab with one hand. The Tab A is heavy so if your laying down watching a video the case slips in your hand so you have to make frequent adjustments. I had to remove the clear plastic shield that covers the screen because it impaired the touch screen operation. This affected the strength of the 1-piece plastic frame the surrounds the Tab A, so now the rubber outer cover feels really flexible and flimsy. Lastly, they made it difficult to get to the S pen. The S pen is in the back bottom right hand corner of the Tab A, and they made the little rubber flap that protects corner swing backwards for access to the S pen. This means in order to get the S pen out, the flap has to swing out 180 degrees. This is really awkward and hard to do with one hand. This case does a good job protecting my Tab A, but with these serious design flaws I can&#39;t recommend it unless you have an S pen, then you don&#39;t have much choice.

INPUT: Received this file box last night, and begin to put my documents in as soon as I received it. It is very good for me as my husband and I get a lot paperwork to save.

INPUT: This gets three stars because it did not give me exactly what I ordered. I ordered 4 of the 100 card lots. So, I wanted 100 Unstable MTG cards per box. Instead, I was given 97 Unstable cards per box, and 4 random MTG commons. I paid for 100 Unstable cards! Not 97 and 4 random cards! Also, the boxes they advertise are not too great. They do the job of holding the cards, but that&#39;s about it. I&#39;m definitely getting a new case for these. If you want to buy, don&#39;t take it too seriously. Don&#39;t expect all 100 cards to be Unstable, and expect multiples.

INPUT: I would love to give this product 5 star but unfortunately it just doesn‚Äôt cut due to quality. I bought them only (and only) for my toddlers snacks. And for that purpose they work great. I would probably use them in other situations as well if they were all the same. And yes I understand, if they are hand carved from one piece of wood, there could be slight difference, but that‚Äôs where product quality control comes in. I guess they just didn‚Äôt want any faulty products and decided to sell them all no matter what.

Yes, she really is a typical girl and does not mind the hair dryer at all. I bought this hoping it would absorb enough to get her dry without any additional towels. Did not work for Stella. Now, I am sure it would work for a small dog and is a very nice towel. If you have a small dog, go ahead and get it.

INPUT: I purchased this for my wife in October, 2017. At the time, we were in the middle of relocating and living in a hotel. I couldn&#39;t get this scale to connect to the Wifi in the hotel. I decided to wait until we moved into our home and I could set up my own Wifi system. March 2018- I have set up my Wifi system and this scale still won&#39;t connect. Every time I try, I get the error message. Even when I am 10&#39; away from the Wifi unit. I followed the YouTube setup video with no success. When I purchased the unit, I thought it would connect directly to my wife&#39;s phone (like Bluetooth). Instead, this scale uses the Wifi router to communicate to the phone. This system is limited to the router connection...which is usually not close to the bedroom unlike a cell phone! I wouldn&#39;t recommend this scale to anyone because of the Wifi connection. Instead, please look at systems that use Bluetooth for communication. I am replacing this with a Bluetooth connection scale.

OUTPUT: positive

INPUT: Seriously the fluffiest towels! The color is beautiful, exactly as pictured, and they are bigger than I expected. Plus, I spent the same amount of money for these that I would have on the &#34;premium&#34; (non-organic) towels from Wal-Mart. You can&#39;t go wrong.
OUTPUT: positive

INPUT: Ultimately I love the look of the curtains, they are beautiful and provide enough light blocking for the room we&#39;re using them in. However, they are not the color pictured. They were only blue and white. I wish that they were the ones that I thought that I had ordered, however, we will keep them because they are still beautiful.

INPUT: The clear backing lacks the stickiness to keep the letters adhered until you‚Äôre finished weeding! It‚Äôs so frustrating to have to keep up with a bunch of letters and pieces that have curled and fell off the paper! It requires additional work to make sure that they‚Äôre aligned properly and being applied on the right side, which was an issue for me several times! I purchased 3 packs of this and while it‚Äôs okay for larger designs, it sucks for lettering or anything intricate üòè Possibly it‚Äôs old and dried out, but in any event, I will not be buying from this vendor again and suggest that you don‚Äôt either!

So I figured at best they should be a little better off. It was better than that! My brushes are like new! A couple I needed to clean two times, but considering how much build up on them there was, was completely warranted.

INPUT: My dog loves this toy, I haven&#39;t seen hear more thrill with any other toy, for the first three days, which is how long the squeaker lasted. She is not a heavy chewer, and in one of her &#34;victory walks&#34; after retrieving the ball, the squeaker was already gone. Apart from that it is my best investment
OUTPUT: neutral

INPUT: I have three of these linked together. As many of the other reviews said, the legs are weak and prone to breakage even with careful use. It is best to provide some other means of support and not use the legs. Also the gaskets at the fittings do not seal well. I used RTV silicone sealant when assembling the water fittings to stop the leakage. These units are doing a good job heating my pool.

INPUT: Looking at orher reviews the tail was supposed to be obscenely long -- it was actually the perfect size but im not sure if thats intentional. The waist strap fits perfectly-- but again, need to list that my waist is fairly wide and it sat on my hips. Im unsure about the life of the strap. To the actual quality the fur seems of a fair (not great but not terrible quality but the tail isnt fully stuffed.) Apparently theres supposed to be a wire to pose the tail. There is none in mine, which is fine cause again, mine came up shorter than others. Im only rating 3 stars because of some unintentional good things.

INPUT: Im not sure if its just this sellers stock of this product or what but the first order was no good, each bottle had mold and clumps in the bottle and usually companies will put a couple of metal beads in a bottle to aid in the mixing but these had a rock in it... like a rock off the ground. I decided to replace the item, same seller, and once again they were all clumpy and gross... I attached a photo. I wouldnt buy these, at least not from this seller.
OUTPUT: negative

INPUT: Too stiff, barely zips, and is very bulky

INPUT: these were ok, but to big for the craft I needed them for. Maybe find something to use them on.
OUTPUT: neutral

INPUT: What a really great set of acrylics. My daughter has been painting with them since they came in. The colors come in a wide range of vibrant colors that have a smooth consistency. These paints are packed in aluminum tubes which allows the paint to not dry or crack over time.
OUTPUT: positive

INPUT: They‚Äôre cute and work well for my kids. Price is definitely great for kids sheets.
OUTPUT: positive

INPUT: Loved the dress fitted like a glove nice material and it feels great
OUTPUT: positive

INPUT: Absolutely terrible. I ordered these expecting a quality product for 10 dollars. They were shipped in an envelope inside of another envelope all just banging against each other while on their way to me from the seller. 3 of them are broken internally, they make a rattle noise as the ones that work do not. I will be requesting a refund for these and filing a complaint with Amazon. Don&#39;t purchase unless you like to buy broken/damaged goods. Completely worthless.

INPUT: Fits great kinda expensive but it‚Äôs good quality
OUTPUT: positive

INPUT: Quality is just okay. Magnet on the back is strong and it&#39;s nice its detachable but the case around the phone isn&#39;t very protective and very flimsy. You get what you pay for.
OUTPUT: neutral

INPUT: The dress fits perfect! It‚Äôs a tad too long but not enough to bother with the hassle of getting it hemmed. The material is extremely comfortable and I love the pockets! I WILL be ordering a couple more in different colors.
OUTPUT: positive

INPUT: Great quality but too wide to fit BBQ Galore Grand Turbo 4 burner with 2 searing bars.

INPUT: This shirt is not long as the picture indicates. It&#39;s just below waist length. Disappointed b/c I am 5&#39;10 and wanted to wear with leggings.
OUTPUT: negative

INPUT: They are so comfortable that I don&#39;t even know I am wearing them.
OUTPUT: positive

INPUT: I bought these for under dresses and they are perfect for that. I did size up to a large instead of a medium because they run small. They hit the knees on me but that‚Äôs because I‚Äôm 4‚Äô11‚Äù
OUTPUT: positive

INPUT: So cute! And fit my son perfect so I‚Äôm not sure about an adult but probably would stretch.
OUTPUT: positive

INPUT: Clasps broke off after having for only a few months üò¢

INPUT: I love how the waist doesn&#39;t have an elastic band in them. I have a bad back and tight waist bands always make my back feel worse.These feel decent...although If they could make them just one size larger..and not just offer plus size....that would be even better for my back.
OUTPUT: positive

INPUT: This is even sexier than the pic! It has good control and is smooth under all my clothes! It&#39;s also comfortable and I&#39;m able to easily wear it all day, it doesn&#39;t roll down either!

OUTPUT: positive

INPUT: They work really well for heartburn and stomach upset. But taking a couple stars off as capsules are poor quality and break. I lost over 30 in a bottle of 120 as they leaked. Powder ended up bottom of bottle.
OUTPUT: neutral

INPUT: This shirt is not long as the picture indicates. It&#39;s just below waist length. Disappointed b/c I am 5&#39;10 and wanted to wear with leggings.
OUTPUT: negative

INPUT: I love these Capris so much that I bought 4 pairs. The high waist helps with tummy control where I have a lot around the waist but skinnier legs and these are perfect. Sometimes with high waist products they tend to roll but these do not and they make your ass look amazing. Highly recommended.

INPUT: Very strong cheap pleather smell that took a few days to air out. One of the straps clips onto the zipper, so be careful of the zipper slowly coming undone as you walk.
OUTPUT: neutral

INPUT: The 8 year old nephew said he wanted this for his birthday. I felt it was a bit much for a toy but he caught me on a good day. Come to find out it&#39;s a fragile collectible so the nephew lost all the small parts the moment he opened it. I guess it&#39;s adequate for collectors that want detail on such a small figurine.

INPUT: Does not work mixed this with process solution and 000 and nothing. Looked exactly the same as i first put it on.
OUTPUT: negative

INPUT: This is a knock off product. This IS NOT a puddle jumper brand float but a flimsy knock off instead. It is missing all stearns and puddle jumper branding on the arms. Do not buy!
OUTPUT: negative

INPUT: Had to use washers even though the bolts were stock like beveled in appearance. 3 pulled through the skid, and there isn&#39;t any rust issues. I called daystar because i spent the money so i wouldn&#39;t have to use washers. They told me to use washers.

INPUT: I have this installed under my spa cover to help maintain the heat. My spa is fully electric (including the heater), and this has done a good job reducing my overall electric bill by about 15% - 20% each month since last November. Quality is holding up fine, but it&#39;s out of the sun since it&#39;s under the spa cover. (Sorry, can&#39;t comment on what the longevity would be in the full sun.)

INPUT: I was very disappointed in this item. It is very soft and not chewy. It falls apart in your hand. My dog eats them but I prefer a more chewy treat for my dog.
OUTPUT: negative

INPUT: Just can&#39;t get use to the lack of taste with this ceylon cinnamon. I have to use so much to get any taste at all. This is the first ceylon I&#39;ve tried so I can&#39;t compare. Just not impressed. I agree with some others that it taste more like red hot candy smells. Hope I can find some that has some flavor. I really don&#39;t want to go back to the other cinnamon that is bad for us.
OUTPUT: neutral

INPUT: I like everything about the pill box except its size. I take a lot of supplements and the dispenser is just too small to hold all the pills that I take.
OUTPUT: neutral

INPUT: They sent HyClean which is NOT for the US market therefore this is deceptive marketing
OUTPUT: negative

INPUT: The glitter gel flows, its super cute.
OUTPUT: positive

INPUT: It is really nice to have my favorite sugar alternative packaged in little take along packets! I LOVE swerve, and it is so convenient to have these to throw in my purse for dining out, or to use at a friend‚Äôs house. While they are a bit pricey, I cannot stand Equal or the pink stuff in my iced tea. Swerve or nothing, so i am thrilled to have my sweetener on the go!

INPUT: It&#39;s an ok bin. I got it to use as a clothes hamper thinking it was more of a linen material, probably my mistake for not reading the description better but it&#39;s actually more like a plastic. Decided it would be better suited for my daughter&#39;s stuff animals. It&#39;s cute and serves a purpose and isn&#39;t all that expensive. Just not what I thought it would be when originally purchasing it.

INPUT: I did a lot of thinking as I read this book. I felt as though I could really picture what the main character was going through. The author did a great job describing the situations and events. I really rooted for the main character and felt her struggles. It seems as though she had to over come a lot to once again over come a lot. She had a group of interesting characters both supporting her and also ones who were against her. Not a plot to be predicted. I highly recommend this book. It grabbed my attention from the first page and had me thinking about it long after. I look forward to reading the author&#39;s next book.

INPUT: It worked for a week. My husband loved it. And then all of the sudden it won&#39;t charge or turn on. It just stopped working.
OUTPUT: negative

INPUT: I saw this and thought it would be good to store the myriad of batts that I have. You must know that this is made to hang on the wall. The lid does not lock down in any way it just hangs lose and bangs into the Size C batts. You can lay it flat but remember the lid does not in any way hold the batteries from falling out if you turn it to the side, Now for me the biggest disappointment is that there are no slots for the batteries that use the most, the CR 123 batts. I rate it just barely useful. I should have read more carefully the description. It is too much trouble to return it so I&#39;ll keep it and buy smaller cases with locking lids
OUTPUT: neutral

INPUT: Quality is just okay. Magnet on the back is strong and it&#39;s nice its detachable but the case around the phone isn&#39;t very protective and very flimsy. You get what you pay for.
OUTPUT: neutral

INPUT: Works very well. Easy to set alarms, and time. The snooze/backlight function is pretty neat too. The dim back light is also nice so that you can actually read the time in the dark.
OUTPUT: positive

INPUT: Works great, bought a 2nd one for my son&#39;s dog. I usually only put them on at night and it stopped the barking immediately. Battery lasted a month. Used a little duct tape to keep the collar at the right length.
OUTPUT: positive

INPUT: Works great and the picture is good, but it doesn&#39;t hold a battery long at all. I actually have to plug it in every night once I lay down or it won&#39;t stay charged.

INPUT: This is the second one of these that I have purchased. It is an excellent platform for a foam or conventional mattress. It is totally sturdy, and looks nice. I highly recommend it. There are many frames out there that will cost you much more, but this does the trick.
OUTPUT: positive

INPUT: These little lights are awesome. They put off a nice amount of light. And you can put them ANYWHERE! I have put one in the pantry. Another in my linen closet. Another one right next to my bed for when I get up in the middle of the night. Have only had them about a month but so far so good!
OUTPUT: positive

INPUT: I love the curls but the hair does shed a little; it has been a month; curls still looks good; I use mousse or leave in conditioner to keep curls looking shiny; hair does tangle

OUTPUT: negative

INPUT: Love this coverup! It‚Äôs super thin and very boho!! Always getting compliments on it!
OUTPUT: positive

INPUT: Bought this item not even three months ago and am already starting to have problems. The steal slates to support the mattress (as advertised NO BOX SPRING NEEDED) does in fact need that extra layer of support. I am currently using about 7 blankets underneath my mattress for support. However my bed does stay in place, there is storage underneath like I needed and all around is a good product. But if you do plan on buying this item make sure you have the extra support for your mattress!!!

INPUT: My dog loves this toy, I haven&#39;t seen hear more thrill with any other toy, for the first three days, which is how long the squeaker lasted. She is not a heavy chewer, and in one of her &#34;victory walks&#34; after retrieving the ball, the squeaker was already gone. Apart from that it is my best investment
OUTPUT: neutral

INPUT: Very cheaply made, its not worth your money, ours came already broken and looks like it&#39;s been played with, retaped, resold.
OUTPUT: negative

INPUT: Maybe it&#39;s just my luck because this seems to happen to me with other products but the motor broke in 2 weeks. That was a bummer. I liked it for the 2 weeks though!

OUTPUT: positive

INPUT: We bought it in hopes my son would stop sucking his thumb. He doesn&#39;t suck it when it&#39;s on but when it&#39;s off for eating, bathing, washing hands... he will still do it. We are now going to try the nail polish with bitter taste. This is a good idea, my son just needs something stronger to beat it.
OUTPUT: neutral

INPUT: After 5 minutes of supervised play, the motor started making high pitched terrible screeching noises. Don&#39;t buy unless you have a tiny, useless little rat of a dog. Wasted $18.00

OUTPUT: neutral

INPUT: These are very fragile. I have a cat who is a bit rambunctious and sometimes knocks my phone off my nightstand while it&#39;s plugged in. He managed to break all of these the first or second time he did that. I&#39;m sure they&#39;re fine if you&#39;re very careful with them, but if whatever you&#39;re charging falls off a table or nightstand while plugged in, these are very likely to stop working quickly.
OUTPUT: negative

INPUT: When I received this product, I took the tracker out of the package and plugged it in in order to charge it-it never turned on! I did that was suggested, but to no avail!
OUTPUT: negative

INPUT: My dog ,a super hyper Yorkie, wouldn&#39;t eat these. Didn&#39;t like the smell of them and probably didn&#39;t like the taste. I did manage to get them down him for 3 days to see if it would help him . The process of getting them down him was traumatic for him and me. They did not seem to have any effect on him one way or another , other than the fact that he didn&#39;t like them and didn&#39;t want to eat them. I ended up throwing them away. Money down the drain. Sorry, I can&#39;t recommend them.
OUTPUT: negative

INPUT: I had to return them. They said they worked to recharge dog bark collars, but neither cord plugged into different USB outlets charged the collar.

OUTPUT: negative

INPUT: To me this product just does not work. Decided to give this a try based on the great reviews this product has. I used it for about two weeks and just did not feel any extra energy nor anything else. Obviously the seller has a good system, maybe even a little scam going on, give me a 5 star review and we will send you a free one. Not saying this will happen to everyone, but these were my results. Happy shopping!
OUTPUT: negative

INPUT: I recieved a totally different product than I ordered (pictured) and I see that I cannot return it !?! I give them one star just because I&#39;m tryin to be nice. I ordered these black hats for a christmas project that I am doin with my 5 yr old son for his classroom and now I&#39;m afraid to even try to reorder them again in fear that I&#39;ll recieve another different product.

I liked the adult hat but it is not sold separately. The seller was rude and unhelpful when I contacted them directly through Amazon. The faux fur pom was either already torn or tore when I was trying on the hat. See the attached photograph. The pom came aprt, exposing the inner fluff.

OUTPUT: positive

INPUT: Perfect color and really cool lighted keyboard, but it dents really easily just being in a backpack as we&#39;ve only used it like 2 weeks and it&#39;s already dented. No instructions given to set up bluetooth or change lighted keyboard options or brightness. Had to look up how to do such using previous customer reviews (from their calls to customer service). Expected it to be more durable for a forty-five dollar+ case. Disappointed it dents so easily.

INPUT: I purchased this for my wife in October, 2017. At the time, we were in the middle of relocating and living in a hotel. I couldn&#39;t get this scale to connect to the Wifi in the hotel. I decided to wait until we moved into our home and I could set up my own Wifi system. March 2018- I have set up my Wifi system and this scale still won&#39;t connect. Every time I try, I get the error message. Even when I am 10&#39; away from the Wifi unit. I followed the YouTube setup video with no success. When I purchased the unit, I thought it would connect directly to my wife&#39;s phone (like Bluetooth). Instead, this scale uses the Wifi router to communicate to the phone. This system is limited to the router connection...which is usually not close to the bedroom unlike a cell phone! I wouldn&#39;t recommend this scale to anyone because of the Wifi connection. Instead, please look at systems that use Bluetooth for communication. I am replacing this with a Bluetooth connection scale.
OUTPUT: negative

INPUT: These are awesome! I just used them on my 12 ft Christmas tree so I could get it out the door. So easy to use that I‚Äôm going to buy another pair.
OUTPUT: positive

INPUT: This product worked just as designed and was very easy to install.The setup is so simple for each load on the trailer.I would def recommend this item for anyone needing a break controller.
OUTPUT: positive

INPUT: The range is terrible on these units. I have to pull all the way into the driveway before it will activate the door. We do like the size and that they are keychains.

INPUT: Received this file box last night, and begin to put my documents in as soon as I received it. It is very good for me as my husband and I get a lot paperwork to save. The colorful tags make it easier to find what I want. The material is strong. I finally get something to help with the messy drawer! Love this product! I believe I will buy another one when this one is full!
OUTPUT: positive

INPUT: I like this swim suit but it fits really small. I am a size 14 and per reviews that&#39;s what I ordered. It runs really small. Also a lot of mesh in the back and on the sides of this suit. Don&#39;t like that. its going back....sad
OUTPUT: negative

INPUT: I really love this product. I love how big it is compare to others diaper changing pads. I love the extra pockets and on top of that you get a free insulated bottle bag. All of that for an amazing price.
OUTPUT: positive

INPUT: So cute! And fit my son perfect so I‚Äôm not sure about an adult but probably would stretch.
OUTPUT: positive

INPUT: Really cute outfit and fit well. But, the two bows fell off the top the first time worn. The bows were glued on opposed to sewn.
OUTPUT: neutral

INPUT: Terrific fabric and fit through belly, hips and thighs, but apparently these should be worn with 3&#34; heels, which is ridiculous for exercise/loungewear. (Yes I&#39;m being sarcastic.) Seriously: these were at least 4&#34; too long to be comfortable (let alone safe to walk in). Back they go, and I won&#39;t try again.
OUTPUT: neutral

INPUT: Somehow a $30 swimsuit off of Amazon is super cute and fits great! I just had a baby and my boobs are huge, but this covered me and I felt super supported in it. It‚Äôs a great suit!

OUTPUT: negative

INPUT: My dog ,a super hyper Yorkie, wouldn&#39;t eat these. Didn&#39;t like the smell of them and probably didn&#39;t like the taste. I did manage to get them down him for 3 days to see if it would help him . The process of getting them down him was traumatic for him and me. They did not seem to have any effect on him one way or another , other than the fact that he didn&#39;t like them and didn&#39;t want to eat them. I ended up throwing them away. Money down the drain. Sorry, I can&#39;t recommend them.

She then starting testing all of them on a piece of paper, several of them began to run out of ink very quickly. Not happy with this product, tried to return, however these markets are an unreturnable item.

Big boot footprints were on two boxes, a big hole in another and all of them were crushed pretty good. I haven&#39;t opened and setup the monitors yet but I&#39;ll be surprised if some aren&#39;t damaged. Probably need a new shipping company or contact them about the shape some of those are in.
OUTPUT: neutral

INPUT: Absolutely terrible. I ordered these expecting a quality product for 10 dollars. They were shipped in an envelope inside of another envelope all just banging against each other while on their way to me from the seller. 3 of them are broken internally, they make a rattle noise as the ones that work do not. I will be requesting a refund for these and filing a complaint with Amazon. Don&#39;t purchase unless you like to buy broken/damaged goods. Completely worthless.

OUTPUT: positive

INPUT: Quality made from a family business. Sometimes a challenge to move around due to the chew toys hanging off but gives our puppy something to knaw on throughout the night. 5 month update: Our dog doesn&#39;t destroy many toys but since he truly loves this one he has ripped off the head, the tail rope, torn a few corner rope rings, put teeth marks in the internal foam and now ripped the underside of the cover. I&#39;m giving this 4 stars still due to the simple fact that he LOVES this thing. Purchased right before they sold out, maybe the new model is more durable. Update with new model: The newer model has some areas where design has decreased in quality. The &#34;tail&#34; rope is not attached nearly as well as the first one. However, so far nothing has been ripped off of it in the 3 weeks since we have received it. He still loves it though!

Now to say this I usually use the Doc Johnson Seven Wonders vibrator which is awesome I think they stop making it so I had to find an alternative so I found this one the price was decent read the reviews you know looked at everybody else reviews and base it off of that so hey I ordered okay so I had it for a few weeks now wanted to give an honest review and honestly... I hate it I think it&#39;s more or less the design of the applicator I don&#39;t really like the fatness of it I really like to sleep slim ones that to me they really stimulate your clit a whole lot better but hey that&#39;s just my opinion I went by it again that we looking for alternative hope this helps anybody on the quest to find a good bullet LOL LOL

INPUT: I would love to give this product 5 star but unfortunately it just doesn‚Äôt cut due to quality. I bought them only (and only) for my toddlers snacks. And for that purpose they work great. I would probably use them in other situations as well if they were all the same. And yes I understand, if they are hand carved from one piece of wood, there could be slight difference, but that‚Äôs where product quality control comes in. I guess they just didn‚Äôt want any faulty products and decided to sell them all no matter what.
OUTPUT: neutral

INPUT: The furniture is a bit smaller and lighter than what I was expecting, but for the price it does the job. I probably will do a bit more research for future outdoor furniture buying, but for now this set is good enough.

INPUT: FIRE HAZARD DO NOT PURCHASE. Used once as instructed wires melted and caught fire!!!
OUTPUT: negative

INPUT: Does not work mixed this with process solution and 000 and nothing. Looked exactly the same as i first put it on.
OUTPUT: negative

INPUT: The iron works good, but its very small, almost delicate. The insulation parts on the tip were plastic not ceramic. Came with the plug that&#39;s a bonus. But it took quite a bit longer then most things on amazon to ship. I use it for soldering race drones, i ordered the smaller tip, and its actually to small for all but my micro drones. Had to order another tip. Gets hot pretty quick. Apparently this is a firmware upgrade you can do to make it better, but i didn&#39;t have to use it.

INPUT: The picture shows the fuel canister with the mosquito repeller attached so I assumed it would be included. However, when I opened the package I discovered there was no fuel. Since it is not included, the picture should be removed. If someone orders this and expects to use it immediately, like I did, they will be very disappointed.

INPUT: Bought this just about 6 months agi and is already broken. Just does not charge the computer and is as good as stone. Would not recommend this and instead buy the original from he Mac store. This product is not worth the price.
OUTPUT: negative

INPUT: This watch was purchased in mid-June. Not even 2 months later it&#39;s losing 45 minutes every 4 hours. The indicator boasts a &#34;full charge&#34; but still, losing &gt;10 minutes every hour - faulty. Amazon&#39;s customer service was A COMPLETE JOKE. I was on the line for over ten minutes (probably longer but my watch runs slow), and got nowhere. Out of warranty.

OUTPUT: negative

INPUT: Ordered two identical rolls. One arrived with the vacuum bag having a large hole poked in the center - almost the size of the center hub hole. Since the roll arrives in a product box the hole either occurred before boxing at the manufacturer or I received a return. The seller responded promptly and asked for photos, which I provided. Then they asked if there was anything wrong with the product. Huh? I replied it has some issues (likely moisture related). Then they asked for details of issues. Huh? Well, I&#39;ve had enough of providing them details of the damaged/defective product.

INPUT: I recieved a totally different product than I ordered (pictured) and I see that I cannot return it !?! I give them one star just because I&#39;m tryin to be nice. I ordered these black hats for a christmas project that I am doin with my 5 yr old son for his classroom and now I&#39;m afraid to even try to reorder them again in fear that I&#39;ll recieve another different product.

Big boot footprints were on two boxes, a big hole in another and all of them were crushed pretty good. I haven&#39;t opened and setup the monitors yet but I&#39;ll be surprised if some aren&#39;t damaged. Probably need a new shipping company or contact them about the shape some of those are in.

OUTPUT: neutral

INPUT: The book is very informative, with great tips and tricks about how to travel as well as what the locations are about which is both it&#39;s good and bad aspect. It gives so much interesting context, it may be overly insightful. For the person who must know everything, this is great. For the person who has no idea. Googling will suffice.

INPUT: The 8 year old nephew said he wanted this for his birthday. I felt it was a bit much for a toy but he caught me on a good day.

INPUT: I opened a bottle of this smart water and took a large drink, it had a very strong disgusting taste (swamp water). I looked into the bottle and found many small particles were floating in the water... a few brown specs and some translucent white. I am completely freaked out and have contacted Coca-Cola, the product manufacture.

Not happy with this product, tried to return, however these markets are an unreturnable item.

INPUT: I am returning product, I‚Äôve been getting the same Wella Brilliance shampoo for years...the darker and cheaper one circled, and the last Two deliveries were the lighter bottle which smells nothing like the product I want and have been using for nearly 10 years. Extremely dissatisfied, why would they have two products and two prices and send the one you DONT PICK????

INPUT: I like these storage bins overall. The color of the lining inside wasn‚Äôt expected, it shows a light brown color in the photo but it‚Äôs pretty dark. I would have preferred the lining inside to match the outside, tan or grey. Other than that they are cute and look as pictured.

INPUT: I use these cartridges all the time, but this is my first time to order them from Amazon (I had a gift card on Amazon that needed to be used). The box which, actually, was shipped from Office Depot was damaged when it arrived; however, the cartridges appear not to be damaged. I&#39;ll find out for sure when I install them (not all at the same time). An interesting thing about my order: I wanted a box of 2 black cartridges, also, but there was a delivery charge on them because the order would be fulfilled by Office Depot - there was free shipping on the color cartridges (fulfilled by Amazon). Rather than pay shipping on the black cartridges, I bought them at the local Walmart for the same price as through Amazon -- no shipping charges. The interesting thing was that when the color cartridges arrived, they had been shipped by Office Depot -- no shipping charges on them. Why shipping charges on black but not color -- price on each was more than the $25 amount required for free shipping and both shipped from Office Depot? Doesn&#39;t make sense to me.

INPUT: Im not sure if its just this sellers stock of this product or what but the first order was no good, each bottle had mold and clumps in the bottle and usually companies will put a couple of metal beads in a bottle to aid in the mixing but these had a rock in it... like a rock off the ground. I decided to replace the item, same seller, and once again they were all clumpy and gross... I attached a photo. I wouldnt buy these, at least not from this seller.

INPUT: This was not like the name brand polymer clays I am used to working with. This is much to plasticky feeling, hard to work with, it won‚Äôt soften up even the slightest bit with the heat from my hands like the name brand polymers. It was difficult to mold, roll, and impossible to create anything halfway decent looking. This is certainly a case of ‚Äúyou get what you pay for‚Äù Stick to the name brand if you want this for anything other than for a kid to mess around with. I am highly disappointed in everything except for the case it came in.

INPUT: There are no pockets for organization inside this bag. There are flat divided areas on the outside but not convenient. The material is good and has been durable thus far.
OUTPUT: neutral

INPUT: Overall I liked the phone especially for the price. The durability is my main issue I dropped the phone once onto a wood floor from about 12 inches and the screen cracked after having it for about 2 weeks. Otherwise it seemed to be a decent phone. It had a few little quirks that took a little getting used to but otherwise I think it wood be a good phone if it was more durable.
OUTPUT: neutral

INPUT: Too stiff, barely zips, and is very bulky
OUTPUT: negative

INPUT: I love how the waist doesn&#39;t have an elastic band in them. I have a bad back and tight waist bands always make my back feel worse.These feel decent...although If they could make them just one size larger..and not just offer plus size....that would be even better for my back.
OUTPUT: positive

INPUT: It will do the job of holding shoes. It&#39;s not glamorous, but it holds shoes and stands in a closet. You will need help with the shelving assembly as it is a two person job.
OUTPUT: neutral

INPUT: All the pockets and functionality are just right. I can&#39;t really find anything about the usability that annoys me such as pockets or organization not quite right. The pockets are placed and sized well and I find them all useful. The most annoying thing about it is that it does not stand up straight on its own, however, it has a very predictable side that it falls to. It leans predictably so it is not an actual issue against it&#39;s overall usability.

INPUT: This dress is very comfortable. I would recommend wearing a slip under it as it is very thin. I‚Äôm going to have to hem the bottom because it‚Äôs long. I‚Äôm 5‚Äô5‚Äù and even in wedges it hits the floor. But it‚Äôs great for the price!
OUTPUT: positive

INPUT: Fantastic belt ,love it . This is my second one , the first one was a little small but this one is perfect. I suggest you order one size bigger than your waist size.
OUTPUT: negative

INPUT: This shirt is not long as the picture indicates. It&#39;s just below waist length. Disappointed b/c I am 5&#39;10 and wanted to wear with leggings.
OUTPUT: negative

INPUT: The black one with the tassels on the front and it looks pretty cute, perfect for summer. I have broad shoulders so the looseness was great for me but if you are more petit you might not love how oversized it can look (specially the sleeves). Please note, it does SHRINK after washing (not even drying) so beware!! Also, it is very short but cute nonetheless.
OUTPUT: neutral

INPUT: It was recommended by a friend and found that things are really good to wear and I like them very much.
OUTPUT: positive

INPUT: Nice lightweight material without being cheap feeling. Generally the design is nice, except the waist. The sewn in waist band is high. If you are long waisted , it would be way above your waist. I am a medium which is what I ordered. The waistband is about at the last rib in the front. When you tie the attached belt there is an improvement. OK as a house dress for me. I&#39;m 5&#39;4&#34; and it&#39;s bit bit long. I just knotted the corners of the bottom hem...that works.

OUTPUT: negative

INPUT: Bought this iPhone for my 9.7‚Äù 6th generation iPad as advertised. Not only did this take over 30 minutes just try to put it on, but it also doesn‚Äôt fit whatsoever. When we did get it on, it just bent right off the sides, exposing the entire edges of all the parts of the iPad. This is the worst piece of garbage I have bought from Amazon in years, save your money and go somewhere else!!
OUTPUT: negative

INPUT: very cute style and design, but tarnished after 1 wear!
OUTPUT: neutral

INPUT: This is THE BEST mascara I have found. I live in south Florida and this stays on through humidity, rain, everything and NO clumping or smudging. It&#39;s buildable and really easy to remove. LOVE IT!

INPUT: For the money, it&#39;s a good buy... but the fingerprint ID just doesn&#39;t work very good. After several attempts, it would not allow me to register my fingerprint. So... I just use the key to lock and unlock the safe, and that&#39;s not a problem. If you want something with the ability to open with your fingerprint, you&#39;ll need to spend a bit more, but if fingerprint id isn&#39;t something you absolutely need to have, then this safe is for you.
OUTPUT: neutral

INPUT: It will not turn on. It was a gift and the person called and said it does not work. It won&#39;t turn on. I would like to send back and get either another or my money back.
OUTPUT: negative

INPUT: Ordered these for my daughter as a Christmas present. When she opened the case 3 of the markers did not have the caps on and were completely dried out. She was very disappointed. She then starting testing all of them on a piece of paper, several of them began to run out of ink very quickly. Not happy with this product, tried to return, however these markets are an unreturnable item.
OUTPUT: negative

INPUT: This product does not work at all. I have tried it on two of my vehicles and it does not cover light scratches. Waste of money.
OUTPUT: negative

INPUT: The paw prints are ALREADY coming off the bottom of the band where you snap it together, I&#39;ve only worn it three times. Very upset that the paw prints have started rubbing off already üò°

OUTPUT: negative

INPUT: Wore it when I went to the bar a couple times and the silver coating started to rub off but for the price I cannot complain. My biggest issue I have with it is it flipping around. Got a lot of compliments though.
OUTPUT: neutral

INPUT: The first guard may serve more as a learning curve. I do kinda prefer to use the ones that come with molding trays. This didn&#39;t help until about 3-4 nights of use. Even then, sometimes it feels like my upper gum underneath, is strange feeling the next morning

INPUT: Very poorly packaged. The glasses banged each other. Should have been bubble wrapped. So bummed that I can‚Äôt use these for a party tonight!
OUTPUT: negative

INPUT: Half of the pads were dried out. The others worked great!
OUTPUT: neutral

INPUT: I&#39;ve been using this product with my laundry for a while now and I like it, but I had to return it because it wasn&#39;t packaged right and everything was damaged.
OUTPUT: negative

INPUT: The clear backing lacks the stickiness to keep the letters adhered until you‚Äôre finished weeding! It‚Äôs so frustrating to have to keep up with a bunch of letters and pieces that have curled and fell off the paper! It requires additional work to make sure that they‚Äôre aligned properly and being applied on the right side, which was an issue for me several times! I purchased 3 packs of this and while it‚Äôs okay for larger designs, it sucks for lettering or anything intricate üòè Possibly it‚Äôs old and dried out, but in any event, I will not be buying from this vendor again and suggest that you don‚Äôt either!
OUTPUT: negative

INPUT: Ordered two identical rolls. One arrived with the vacuum bag having a large hole poked in the center - almost the size of the center hub hole. Since the roll arrives in a product box the hole either occurred before boxing at the manufacturer or I received a return. The seller responded promptly and asked for photos, which I provided. Then they asked if there was anything wrong with the product. Huh? I replied it has some issues (likely moisture related). Then they asked for details of issues. Huh? Well, I&#39;ve had enough of providing them details of the damaged/defective product.
OUTPUT: neutral

INPUT: The product is fine and the delivery was fast, but there&#39;s no way to seal the package once it&#39;s opened. There&#39;s a wide piece of tape, but you have to cut the package open to get into it unlike most wipes that have a slit with an adhesive to cover it afterward. If you don&#39;t seal them back up they go dry and are useless.

OUTPUT: positive

INPUT: Really cute outfit and fit well. But, the two bows fell off the top the first time worn. The bows were glued on opposed to sewn.
OUTPUT: neutral

INPUT: As a hard shell jacket, it‚Äôs pretty good. I ordered the extra large for a skiing trip. It comes small so order a size bigger then normal. I can not use the fleece liner because it is too small. The hard shell is not water proof. I live in the Pacific Northwest and this is not enough to keep you dry. I really like the look of this jacket too.
OUTPUT: neutral

INPUT: Perfect brush, small radius, and good quality.
OUTPUT: positive

INPUT: Overall I liked the phone especially for the price. The durability is my main issue I dropped the phone once onto a wood floor from about 12 inches and the screen cracked after having it for about 2 weeks. Otherwise it seemed to be a decent phone. It had a few little quirks that took a little getting used to but otherwise I think it wood be a good phone if it was more durable.
OUTPUT: neutral

INPUT: I thought it was much bigger, it&#39;s look like a new born baby ear ring.

INPUT: For the S3 Gold: Color matches perfectly, but the band I received is not the same quality as the other BRG bands I‚Äôve bought. The middle metal clasp that attaches to the watch is extremely loose. The entire clasp that slides into the watch is also loose and wiggles. The magnetic clasp to lock the bracelet in place also slides off easily. I love that the color matches, but I either got a defective band or the quality has gone down.
OUTPUT: negative

INPUT: This item appears to be the same as one I purchased from a local hardware store a year or so ago, but it is not finished or burnished to the quality of the one I previously purchased. As such it looks dull, but not exceedingly so. It is close enough to be acceptable.

OUTPUT: neutral

INPUT: This cable is not of very good quality. It doesn‚Äôt fit right so you have to hold the connector to the port in order to work.
OUTPUT: negative

INPUT: Not enough information and it seems to behave erratically. Not contacted Tech Support yet. Support URL in printed instructions is dead. Needs better instructions for VOIP POTS without cordless phones in home. I am somewhat allergic to radios. Literature does not tell what to expect when CPR Call blocker is disconnected for short period of time. It depends entirely on talk line battery. I need it to work and am not giving up. Tech support seems to be illusive.
OUTPUT: neutral

INPUT: Had some problems getting it to work. The supplied cable was no good - would not charge the battery. When I replaced cable with my own was able to charge and then connect the device via bluetooth to a PC. Had trouble finding the PC software but when I emailed their support they responded within a day with the correct download info. PC program works well for testing the unit after you figure out which port to use (port 4 in my case). The accuracy and stability of the unit look very good for my application, however I was not able to connect to either an iPhone or iPad (tried several of each) via bluetooth. Will have to hard-wire if I decide to use this device in my product.
OUTPUT: neutral

INPUT: Worst cable I have had to date for my iphone. It&#39;s so stiff if you move it at all while plugged in, it disconnects. I have to carefully plug it in all the way and it doesn&#39;t give that really solid click feel, then if disturbed at all it loses connection. I have another Anker Powerline 1 cable and it has been great. Not sure how the II can go backwards. My window to return has closed so I guess I&#39;ll contact them directly and see if they will replace with a different cable.

INPUT: I bought this modem/router about two years ago. At the start it seemed to be ok but for the last year plus I‚Äôve had problems with it dropping the internet. This happens on all my devices both Wi-Fi and wired. The only way to restore service was to do a AC power reset. This was happening once or twice a day. Comcast came out, ran a new coax line from the pedestal to the house and boosted the signal level. Same problem. The Arris Tech guys were great but could not solve the problem. Additionally, I lost the 5G service on three occasions. I had to do a factory reset to restore this. I cannot recommend this modem/router based upon my experiences. I purchased a Netgear AC1900 modem/router. It‚Äôs fantastic. I‚Äôv Had it for over a week with no problems. It‚Äôs faster and the range is greater than the Arris. I read online that other people have had problems with the Arris modem/router connected to Comcast. If you have Comcast internet I do not recommend this Arris modem/router. Get the Netgear, its much more reliable.
OUTPUT: negative

INPUT: The case and disc were clean when I got them. No cracks to the case and the game worked as needed. The game itself is wonderful, full of adventure. There isn&#39;t much in replay value per se, yet most of the players find themselves going back for more, if only to level up their characters.

INPUT: I did a lot of thinking as I read this book. I felt as though I could really picture what the main character was going through. The author did a great job describing the situations and events. I really rooted for the main character and felt her struggles. It seems as though she had to over come a lot to once again over come a lot. She had a group of interesting characters both supporting her and also ones who were against her. Not a plot to be predicted. I highly recommend this book.

The only issue is the light bulb heats up too fast and the light goes out, so I have to turn it off wait for a while then turn it back on. I don&#39;t think that is supposed to happen...I don&#39;t know if I have a defective light or what, but it is a very nice ring light besides the overheating.

INPUT: I did a lot of thinking as I read this book. I felt as though I could really picture what the main character was going through. The author did a great job describing the situations and events. I really rooted for the main character and felt her struggles. It seems as though she had to over come a lot to once again over come a lot. She had a group of interesting characters both supporting her and also ones who were against her. Not a plot to be predicted. I highly recommend this book. It grabbed my attention from the first page and had me thinking about it long after. I look forward to reading the author&#39;s next book.
OUTPUT: positive

INPUT: I bought these for a replacement for the original band that broke. Fits perfectly with no issues.
OUTPUT: positive

INPUT: The small cover didn‚Äôt seem to work very well. I don‚Äôt feel that they do Avery good job from keeping the avocado from turning brown
OUTPUT: neutral

INPUT: Ordered this for a Santa present and Christmas Eve noticed it came broken!
OUTPUT: negative

INPUT: my problem with the product is the fit. I have a large head and it is too tight everywhere and the neck just doesnt feel right. I want to pull it down but then my nose has no room. I can&#39;t use it because of the poor fit.
OUTPUT: negative

INPUT: This case is ok, but not exceptional - a 3.5 or 4 max. The issue is there are fewer cases available for the Tab A 10.1 w S pen. Of those the Gumdrop is about the best, but it has some serious issues. The case rubber (silicone, whatever) is very smooth and slick, and doesn&#39;t give you a lot of confidence when hold the Tab with one hand. The Tab A is heavy so if your laying down watching a video the case slips in your hand so you have to make frequent adjustments. I had to remove the clear plastic shield that covers the screen because it impaired the touch screen operation. This affected the strength of the 1-piece plastic frame the surrounds the Tab A, so now the rubber outer cover feels really flexible and flimsy. Lastly, they made it difficult to get to the S pen. The S pen is in the back bottom right hand corner of the Tab A, and they made the little rubber flap that protects corner swing backwards for access to the S pen. This means in order to get the S pen out, the flap has to swing out 180 degrees. This is really awkward and hard to do with one hand. This case does a good job protecting my Tab A, but with these serious design flaws I can&#39;t recommend it unless you have an S pen, then you don&#39;t have much choice.

INPUT: I am returning product, I‚Äôve been getting the same Wella Brilliance shampoo for years...the darker and cheaper one circled, and the last Two deliveries were the lighter bottle which smells nothing like the product I want and have been using for nearly 10 years. Extremely dissatisfied, why would they have two products and two prices and send the one you DONT PICK????
OUTPUT: negative

INPUT: These rings are dainty &amp; adorable! Can be worn alone or stacked. The craftsmanship put into these rings, is very evident! I will definitely be buying more!!
OUTPUT: positive

INPUT: my expectations were low for a cheap scale. they were not met, scale doesnt work. popped the cover off the back to put a battery in and the wires were cut and damaged. wouldn&#39;t even turn on. sending it back. product is flimsy and cheap, spend 20 extra bucks on a better brand or scale.
OUTPUT: negative

INPUT: For the S3 Gold: Color matches perfectly, but the band I received is not the same quality as the other BRG bands I‚Äôve bought. The middle metal clasp that attaches to the watch is extremely loose. The entire clasp that slides into the watch is also loose and wiggles. The magnetic clasp to lock the bracelet in place also slides off easily. I love that the color matches, but I either got a defective band or the quality has gone down.
OUTPUT: negative

INPUT: You want an HONEST answer? I just returned from UPS where I returned the FARCE of an earring set to Amazon. It did NOT look like what I saw on Amazon. Only a baby would be able to wear the size of the earring. They were SO small. the size of a pin head I at first thought Amazon had forgotten to enclose them in the bag! I didn&#39;t bother to take them out of the bag and you can have them back. Will NEVER order another thing from your company. A disgrace. Honest enough for you? Grandma
OUTPUT: negative

INPUT: When you order a product, you expect the product to be as described. They were advertised as CAP Dumbbells. However, the product received was Golds Gym dumbbells. If I wanted Golds Gym, I would have bought these from Walmart. I have a complete set of CAP dumbbells, with the exception of my one set from Golds Gym. Is the weight correct, yes. Due they perform, yes. I just expect to get what I paid for not something else. After reading a few other reviews, I see that others have had the same issue.

INPUT: The battery life is terrible compared to earlier versions, an all day reading episode uses it up. It is not something I could count on for a long trip without power nearby. Also, it often goes back several pages quickly because my hand gets near the left edge. I regret buying this version.

OUTPUT: positive

INPUT: Just can&#39;t get use to the lack of taste with this ceylon cinnamon. I have to use so much to get any taste at all. This is the first ceylon I&#39;ve tried so I can&#39;t compare. Just not impressed. I agree with some others that it taste more like red hot candy smells. Hope I can find some that has some flavor. I really don&#39;t want to go back to the other cinnamon that is bad for us.

Filled with intrigue, steamy romance &amp; nail biting ending. Have read two other books of yours. Am looking forward to more.
OUTPUT: positive

INPUT: this is a great book for parents who want to maximize their kids health but not lose the flavor and fun of food. spices are not spicy, they‚Äôre health boosting and delicious. i love spice momma‚Äôs creative recipes and can‚Äôt wait for more from her.

OUTPUT: negative

INPUT: I saw this and thought it would be good to store the myriad of batts that I have. You must know that this is made to hang on the wall. The lid does not lock down in any way it just hangs lose and bangs into the Size C batts. You can lay it flat but remember the lid does not in any way hold the batteries from falling out if you turn it to the side, Now for me the biggest disappointment is that there are no slots for the batteries that use the most, the CR 123 batts. I rate it just barely useful. I should have read more carefully the description. It is too much trouble to return it so I&#39;ll keep it and buy smaller cases with locking lids

Come to find out it&#39;s a fragile collectible so the nephew lost all the small parts the moment he opened it. I guess it&#39;s adequate for collectors that want detail on such a small figurine.

INPUT: This dress is very comfortable. I would recommend wearing a slip under it as it is very thin. I‚Äôm going to have to hem the bottom because it‚Äôs long. I‚Äôm 5‚Äô5‚Äù and even in wedges it hits the floor. But it‚Äôs great for the price!

INPUT: I love how the waist doesn&#39;t have an elastic band in them. I have a bad back and tight waist bands always make my back feel worse.These feel decent...although If they could make them just one size larger..and not just offer plus size....that would be even better for my back.
OUTPUT: positive

INPUT: We ordered 4 diff brands so we could compare and try them out and this one was by far the worst, once you sat down. You felt squished. I‚Äôm 5.5 and 120 lbs. My husband could barely fit.

INPUT: For the money, it&#39;s a good buy... but the fingerprint ID just doesn&#39;t work very good. After several attempts, it would not allow me to register my fingerprint. So... I just use the key to lock and unlock the safe, and that&#39;s not a problem.

INPUT: We bring the kid to Cape Cod this long weekend. The shelter is very helpful when we stay on the beach. Kid feel comfortable when she was in the shelter. It was cool inside of shelter especially if you put some water on the top of the shelter. It is also very easy to carry and set up. It is a good product with high quality.

INPUT: These are very fragile. I have a cat who is a bit rambunctious and sometimes knocks my phone off my nightstand while it&#39;s plugged in. He managed to break all of these the first or second time he did that. I&#39;m sure they&#39;re fine if you&#39;re very careful with them, but if whatever you&#39;re charging falls off a table or nightstand while plugged in, these are very likely to stop working quickly.

INPUT: The book is very informative, with great tips and tricks about how to travel as well as what the locations are about which is both it&#39;s good and bad aspect. It gives so much interesting context, it may be overly insightful. For the person who must know everything, this is great. For the person who has no idea. Googling will suffice.
OUTPUT: neutral

INPUT: I like this series. The main characters are unusual and very damaged from a terrible childhood. Will is an excellent investigator but due to a disability he believes he is illiterate. Slaughter does a very good job showing how people with dyslexia learn ways to hide their limitations. It will be interesting to see how these characters play out in the future. I understand that Slaughter brings some of the characters from the Grant County series to this series. The crimes are brutal. I&#39;m sure this is a good representation of what police come across in their career. The procedural is well done and kept me interested from start to finish. I&#39;m looking forward to reading more of this series soon.
OUTPUT: positive

INPUT: Just received in mail, I think I received a used one as it had writing in the first 3 pages. And someone else&#39;s name... Otherwise seems like pretty good quality

INPUT: The child hat is ridiculously small. It was not even close to the right size for my 3 year old son. I checked the size, and it wouldn&#39;t have even fit him as a newborn. I liked the adult hat but it is not sold separately. The seller was rude and unhelpful when I contacted them directly through Amazon. The faux fur pom was either already torn or tore when I was trying on the hat. See the attached photograph. The pom came aprt, exposing the inner fluff.
OUTPUT: negative

INPUT: My twin grand babies will not be here until March. So we have not used them yet. The only thing so far that I was let down by was the set for the girl showed a cute bow, when I got it, it was just the cap. You should not show the boy in the picture.

The portion control is good and the feeder mechanism has worked reliably. The camera provides a clear picture and it&#39;s great to be able to check remotely that the cat really is getting fed. Setup was relatively easy.

INPUT: Looking at orher reviews the tail was supposed to be obscenely long -- it was actually the perfect size but im not sure if thats intentional. The waist strap fits perfectly-- but again, need to list that my waist is fairly wide and it sat on my hips. Im unsure about the life of the strap. To the actual quality the fur seems of a fair (not great but not terrible quality but the tail isnt fully stuffed.) Apparently theres supposed to be a wire to pose the tail. There is none in mine, which is fine cause again, mine came up shorter than others. Im only rating 3 stars because of some unintentional good things.
OUTPUT: neutral

INPUT: Great idea! My nose is always cold and I can&#39;t fall asleep when it is cold, but for some reason this isn&#39;t keeping my nose warm.
OUTPUT: neutral

INPUT: I bought the tie-dyed version and it was SO comfortable. Stretchy breathable material. I decided to buy the black version for work. Bad decision! The material is completely different. It doesn‚Äôt stretch, it‚Äôs not breathable and it is very small and uncomfortable! It even seems it‚Äôs stitched differently so that it coveres 50% less of my head. So disappointing!!
OUTPUT: negative

INPUT: Very strong cheap pleather smell that took a few days to air out. One of the straps clips onto the zipper, so be careful of the zipper slowly coming undone as you walk.

INPUT: Ordered two identical rolls. One arrived with the vacuum bag having a large hole poked in the center - almost the size of the center hub hole. Since the roll arrives in a product box the hole either occurred before boxing at the manufacturer or I received a return. The seller responded promptly and asked for photos, which I provided. Then they asked if there was anything wrong with the product. Huh? I replied it has some issues (likely moisture related). Then they asked for details of issues. Huh?

INPUT: Had some problems getting it to work. The supplied cable was no good - would not charge the battery. When I replaced cable with my own was able to charge and then connect the device via bluetooth to a PC. Had trouble finding the PC software but when I emailed their support they responded within a day with the correct download info. PC program works well for testing the unit after you figure out which port to use (port 4 in my case). The accuracy and stability of the unit look very good for my application, however I was not able to connect to either an iPhone or iPad (tried several of each) via bluetooth. Will have to hard-wire if I decide to use this device in my product.

I&#39;m sure they&#39;re fine if you&#39;re very careful with them, but if whatever you&#39;re charging falls off a table or nightstand while plugged in, these are very likely to stop working quickly.
OUTPUT: negative

INPUT: They are so comfortable that I don&#39;t even know I am wearing them.
OUTPUT: positive

INPUT: The first guard may serve more as a learning curve. I do kinda prefer to use the ones that come with molding trays. This didn&#39;t help until about 3-4 nights of use. Even then, sometimes it feels like my upper gum underneath, is strange feeling the next morning
OUTPUT: neutral

OUTPUT: negative

INPUT: Overall I liked the phone especially for the price. The durability is my main issue I dropped the phone once onto a wood floor from about 12 inches and the screen cracked after having it for about 2 weeks. Otherwise it seemed to be a decent phone. It had a few little quirks that took a little getting used to but otherwise I think it wood be a good phone if it was more durable.
OUTPUT: neutral

INPUT: Received this file box last night, and begin to put my documents in as soon as I received it. It is very good for me as my husband and I get a lot paperwork to save.

I believe I will buy another one when this one is full!

INPUT: These are great for SO many things. Originally I had them in my drink at a club but then later bought them for my wedding center pieces.

Great customer service!
OUTPUT: positive

INPUT: Love the lights, however, if you leave them in the on position for more than a few days in order to use the remote, the batteries drain quickly whether the candles are actually lit up or not.

INPUT: Absolutely terrible. I ordered these expecting a quality product for 10 dollars. They were shipped in an envelope inside of another envelope all just banging against each other while on their way to me from the seller. 3 of them are broken internally, they make a rattle noise as the ones that work do not. I will be requesting a refund for these and filing a complaint with Amazon. Don&#39;t purchase unless you like to buy broken/damaged goods. Completely worthless.
OUTPUT: negative

INPUT: Maybe it&#39;s just my luck because this seems to happen to me with other products but the motor broke in 2 weeks. That was a bummer. I liked it for the 2 weeks though!
OUTPUT: neutral

INPUT: Product received was not the product ordered. It was a different set without a kettle and their were ants crawling in and out of the box so i didnt even open it but the picture shows a different item with no kettle. I was sent the same thing as a replacement. Fast shipping though.
OUTPUT: negative

INPUT: The packaging of this product was terrible. Just the device with no instructions in a box with no bubble wrap. Device rolling around in a box 3x‚Äôs it‚Äôs size. No order slip.
OUTPUT: neutral

INPUT: It was a great kit to put together but one gear is warped and i am finding myself ripping my hair out sanding and adjusting it to try to get it to tick more than a few seconds at a time.
OUTPUT: neutral

INPUT: Not only was the product poorly packaged, it did not work and made a horrible grinding noise when turned on. To make matters worse, I followed ALL return instructions and still have not been issued my refund! Would give zero stars if I could.

I‚Äôll try gorilla glue or something to see if the ring can be securely affixed to the glass. Surprisingly poor design for something so beautiful.

INPUT: BEST NO SHOW SOCK EVER! Period, soft, NEVER slips, and is a slightly thick sock. Not to thick though, perfect for running shoes too!
OUTPUT: positive

INPUT: I&#39;m never buying pads again! I&#39;ve been using these for months now and I absolutely love them. They&#39;re super durable and easy to clean, great for people with sensitive skin or who have allergies. These are soft, hypoallergenic, and super absorbent without feeling like wearing a diaper or something (at least, that&#39;s how I used to feel wearing pads). The money you spend now saves you ever having to spend on pads again.

INPUT: It‚Äôs a nice looking piece of furniture when assembled, but assembly was difficult. Some of the letter markings were incorrectly marked so I had to try and figure out on my own The screws they supplied to attach the floor and side panels all cracked. I had to go out and purchase corner brackets to make sure they stayed together. Also the glass panel doors are out of line and don‚Äôt match evenly. This alignment prevents one of the doors from staying closed as the magnet to keep the door closed is out of line. Still haven‚Äôt figured out to align them.

INPUT: There was some question on as to whether or not these were solid stainless steel or not on the listing. Since the seller made a point of saying they were solid, I decided to give it a shot. The bad news: my grill was 1/2&#34; too wide, so I had to saw off the nubs on the end of the grates to fit. The good news: they are definitely solid stainless as advertised, so I am not worried about these grates de-laminating like my old factory grates. Glad I bought these. They look great, well-constructed and feel heavy duty. Can&#39;t wait to fire up the grill!

INPUT: As a hard shell jacket, it‚Äôs pretty good. I ordered the extra large for a skiing trip. It comes small so order a size bigger then normal. I can not use the fleece liner because it is too small. The hard shell is not water proof. I live in the Pacific Northwest and this is not enough to keep you dry. I really like the look of this jacket too.

INPUT: The umbrella itself is great but buyer beware they send you a random umbrella and not the design you pick. It&#39;s a good thing my daughter likes all the Disney princesses or I would have had an upset 3 year old. I picked a design that showed 4 different princesses on it and received one that had only snow white and the 7 dwarfs on it. When I went to the site I read the fine print that they pick the umbrellas at random so no need to return.

INPUT: This is definitely the shampoo the Stars use. My hair is never smelt better or felt softer in my entire life.

INPUT: I did a lot of thinking as I read this book. I felt as though I could really picture what the main character was going through. The author did a great job describing the situations and events. I really rooted for the main character and felt her struggles. It seems as though she had to over come a lot to once again over come a lot. She had a group of interesting characters both supporting her and also ones who were against her. Not a plot to be predicted. I highly recommend this book. It grabbed my attention from the first page and had me thinking about it long after. I look forward to reading the author&#39;s next book.

INPUT: 3 1/2 Stars Remedy is a brothers best friend romance as well as a second chance romance mixed into one. It&#39;s a unique story, and the hero (Grady) has to do everything to get Collins back and prove he&#39;s the guy for her. Three years ago, Grady and Collins had an amazing night together. Collins thought she was finally getting everything she dreamed of, her brothers best friend... but when she woke up alone the next morning, and never heard from her, things definitely changed. Now Grady is back, and he&#39;s not leaving, and he&#39;s doing everything in his power to prove to her why he left, and that he&#39;s not giving her up this time around. While I loved the premise of this story, and at times Grady, he really got on my nerves. I totally understand his reasoning for leaving that night, but to not even send a letter to Collins explaining himself? To leave her wondering and hurt for all those years, and then expect her to welcome him back with open arms? Was he delusional?! Collins was right to be upset, angry, hurt, etc. She was right to put up a fight with him when he wanted her back and to move forward. I admire her will power, because Grady was persistent. I loved Collins in this book, she was strong, and she guarded her heart, and I admired her for that. Sure she loved Grady, but she was scared, and hesitant to let him back in her life, who wouldn&#39;t be after what he did to her? Her character was definitely my favorite out of the two. She definitely let things go at the pace she wanted, and when she was ready to listen, she listened. There is a lot of angst in this book, and I did enjoy watching these two reconnect when Collins started to forgive Grady, I just wish Grady would have not come off as so whiney and would have been a little more understanding. He kept saying he understood, but at times he was a little too pushy to me, and then he was sweet towards the end. I ended up loving him just as much as Collins, but in the beginning of the book, I had a hard time reading his points of view because I couldn&#39;t connect with his character. The first part of this book, was not my favorite, but he second part? I adored, hence my rating. If you like second chance, and brothers best friend romances, you may really enjoy this book, I just had a hard time with Grady at first and how he handled some of the things he did.
OUTPUT: neutral

INPUT: This book was okay I guess. I was not really fond of Jaime&#39;s views on things but oh well. Quinn was a wise cracker, but otherwise okay. Jaime should have set her parents down when she was younger and told them both they were messing up her life, maybe she wouldn&#39;t have been so messed up. Otherwise it was okay book.

OUTPUT: neutral

INPUT: For a fitness tracker it is adequate. Heart rate monitor works ok. I feel it has missed steps in my everyday walking but if you start the monitor for fitness then it does well. If you hold anything in the arm with the tracker and cant move your arm it counts nothing. Battery life on the tracker is amazing. It lasts 7 to 8 days on a charge. It charges very fast. The wrist band is not very comfortable. Do to the way it charges i am not sure you can switch bands. I have not looked into this.

INPUT: The clear backing lacks the stickiness to keep the letters adhered until you‚Äôre finished weeding! It‚Äôs so frustrating to have to keep up with a bunch of letters and pieces that have curled and fell off the paper! It requires additional work to make sure that they‚Äôre aligned properly and being applied on the right side, which was an issue for me several times! I purchased 3 packs of this and while it‚Äôs okay for larger designs, it sucks for lettering or anything intricate üòè Possibly it‚Äôs old and dried out, but in any event, I will not be buying from this vendor again and suggest that you don‚Äôt either!
OUTPUT: negative

INPUT: I like these storage bins overall. The color of the lining inside wasn‚Äôt expected, it shows a light brown color in the photo but it‚Äôs pretty dark. I would have preferred the lining inside to match the outside, tan or grey. Other than that they are cute and look as pictured.

INPUT: This sweatshirt changed my life. I wore this sweatshirt almost every single day from January 25th, 2017 up until last week or so when the hood fell off after almost a year of abuse. This sweatshirt has made me realize that the small things in life are the things that matter. Thank you Hanes, keep doing what you do. Love, Justin

INPUT: Received this file box last night, and begin to put my documents in as soon as I received it. It is very good for me as my husband and I get a lot paperwork to save. The colorful tags make it easier to find what I want. The material is strong. I finally get something to help with the messy drawer! Love this product! I believe I will buy another one when this one is full!
OUTPUT: positive

INPUT: I got this backpack Monday night and I was excited about it because I had seen many great reviews for it. I used it for the first time the next day to hold a fair amount of things, and while I was out I noticed this huge rip right down the middle that wasn&#39;t there before. I would have been more understanding if I had it for a few months but this was the first time I had put anything into it. I&#39;ve never been more disappointed in a product before as I have with this backpack. Be very careful when considering purchasing this product.

INPUT: Beautifully crafted. No problem removing cake from pan and the cakes look very nice
OUTPUT: positive

INPUT: Arrived today and a bit disappointed. Great color and nice backing, BUT not thick and plush for the high price. Except fot the backing, you can find the same thickness at your local Walmart for a lot less money.
OUTPUT: neutral

INPUT: This is a great little portable table. Easy to build and tuck away in a corner. One big flaw is that the tabletop comes off easily. Adjusting the height becomes a 2 hand job or else the top may come off when pressing the lever.
OUTPUT: neutral

INPUT: Just received it and so far so good. No issues, did a great job. For a family on a budget trying to waste as least food as possible, it is a great investment and it was very affordable too.
OUTPUT: positive

INPUT: A great purchase. I was looking at pottery barn chairs but was so put off by their price that I looked elsewhere. This chair is very comfortable, looks fabulous, and great for nursing my baby.

Only a baby would be able to wear the size of the earring. They were SO small. the size of a pin head I at first thought Amazon had forgotten to enclose them in the bag! I didn&#39;t bother to take them out of the bag and you can have them back. Will NEVER order another thing from your company. A disgrace. Honest enough for you? Grandma

OUTPUT: negative

INPUT: Quality made from a family business. Sometimes a challenge to move around due to the chew toys hanging off but gives our puppy something to knaw on throughout the night. 5 month update: Our dog doesn&#39;t destroy many toys but since he truly loves this one he has ripped off the head, the tail rope, torn a few corner rope rings, put teeth marks in the internal foam and now ripped the underside of the cover. I&#39;m giving this 4 stars still due to the simple fact that he LOVES this thing. Purchased right before they sold out, maybe the new model is more durable. Update with new model: The newer model has some areas where design has decreased in quality. The &#34;tail&#34; rope is not attached nearly as well as the first one. However, so far nothing has been ripped off of it in the 3 weeks since we have received it. He still loves it though!
OUTPUT: neutral

INPUT: It had to be changed very frequently. Even with the filter we had to empty the water and refill because the water would get nasty, the filters put black specs in the water. And it stopped working after 3 months

INPUT: The iron works good, but its very small, almost delicate. The insulation parts on the tip were plastic not ceramic. Came with the plug that&#39;s a bonus.

INPUT: I love the glass design and the shape is comfortable in one hand. My first purchase of this kettle lasted for two years of daily use. The hinge on the lid is fragile, and since the lid doesn&#39;t flip entirely back - it gets strained and broke within the year. Everything else worked fine until the auto shut-off stopped working after two years. For safety, I bought a new one which has now stopped working entirely after 17 months. I still love the design, but for $58 I expected it to last longer.
OUTPUT: neutral

INPUT: I like these storage bins overall. The color of the lining inside wasn‚Äôt expected, it shows a light brown color in the photo but it‚Äôs pretty dark. I would have preferred the lining inside to match the outside, tan or grey. Other than that they are cute and look as pictured.
OUTPUT: neutral

INPUT: I found this stable and very helpful to get things off the floor, as well as to be able to store below and on top of. Nice that it&#39;s adjustable.
OUTPUT: positive

INPUT: Excellent workmanship, beautiful appearance, and just the right size, installation is simple, special and stable. It can put a lot of things such as the usual utensils, dishes, and cups however, the biggest advantage is that it can save space.

I will be requesting a refund for these and filing a complaint with Amazon. Don&#39;t purchase unless you like to buy broken/damaged goods. Completely worthless.

INPUT: Didn&#39;t expect much for the price, and that&#39;s about what I got. It covers and protects my table, just have to live with a grid of folds from packaging. Seller advised to use a hair dryer to flatten out the wrinkles, but it was a very painstakingly slow process that only took some of the sharp edges off of the folds, didn&#39;t make much difference. Going to invest in something better (and much more expensive) for daily use, this is OK for what it does.

INPUT: So far my daughter loves it. She uses it for school backpack. As far as durable, we just got it, so we will have to see.
OUTPUT: positive

INPUT: Upsetting...these only work if you have a thin phone and or no phone case at all. I&#39;m not going to take my phone&#39;s case (which isn&#39;t thick) off Everytime I want to use the stand. Wast of money. Don&#39;t buy if you use a phone case to protect your phone it&#39;s too thin.
OUTPUT: negative

INPUT: This is a knock off product. This IS NOT a puddle jumper brand float but a flimsy knock off instead. It is missing all stearns and puddle jumper branding on the arms. Do not buy!
OUTPUT: negative

INPUT: This case is ok, but not exceptional - a 3.5 or 4 max. The issue is there are fewer cases available for the Tab A 10.1 w S pen. Of those the Gumdrop is about the best, but it has some serious issues. The case rubber (silicone, whatever) is very smooth and slick, and doesn&#39;t give you a lot of confidence when hold the Tab with one hand. The Tab A is heavy so if your laying down watching a video the case slips in your hand so you have to make frequent adjustments. I had to remove the clear plastic shield that covers the screen because it impaired the touch screen operation. This affected the strength of the 1-piece plastic frame the surrounds the Tab A, so now the rubber outer cover feels really flexible and flimsy. Lastly, they made it difficult to get to the S pen. The S pen is in the back bottom right hand corner of the Tab A, and they made the little rubber flap that protects corner swing backwards for access to the S pen. This means in order to get the S pen out, the flap has to swing out 180 degrees. This is really awkward and hard to do with one hand. This case does a good job protecting my Tab A, but with these serious design flaws I can&#39;t recommend it unless you have an S pen, then you don&#39;t have much choice.
OUTPUT: neutral

INPUT: I found this stable and very helpful to get things off the floor, as well as to be able to store below and on top of. Nice that it&#39;s adjustable.
OUTPUT: positive

INPUT: Great product, I got this for my dad because he tends to drop a lot of objects and when i got him his airpod case, i was worried it might break. This case did the job and the texture made it non slip so it wont fall off surfaces as easily. The clip also makes it easy for my dad to clip it to his work bag so it wont get lost easily.

OUTPUT: neutral

INPUT: I opened a bottle of this smart water and took a large drink, it had a very strong disgusting taste (swamp water).

OUTPUT: positive

INPUT: It was a great kit to put together but one gear is warped and i am finding myself ripping my hair out sanding and adjusting it to try to get it to tick more than a few seconds at a time.

OUTPUT: negative

INPUT: This fan was checked out before the installer left. Later that day I turned it on and the globe was wobbling a lot.

That was two weeks ago and the fan is still fine. It is very attractive and quiet.

INPUT: Arrived today and a bit disappointed. Great color and nice backing, BUT not thick and plush for the high price. Except fot the backing, you can find the same thickness at your local Walmart for a lot less money.
OUTPUT: neutral

INPUT: It will do the job of holding shoes. It&#39;s not glamorous, but it holds shoes and stands in a closet. You will need help with the shelving assembly as it is a two person job.
OUTPUT: neutral

INPUT: The dress fits perfect! It‚Äôs a tad too long but not enough to bother with the hassle of getting it hemmed. The material is extremely comfortable and I love the pockets! I WILL be ordering a couple more in different colors.
OUTPUT: positive

INPUT: The beige mat looked orange on my beige flooring so I returned it and ordered a gray mat from another company that was $7 less to be safe on the color.
OUTPUT: neutral

INPUT: great throw for high end sofa, and works with any style even contemporary sleek sectionals
OUTPUT: positive

INPUT: This is a beautiful rug. exactly what I was looking for. When I received it, I was very impressed with the color. However, it is very thin. My dinning room table sets on it so I don&#39;t think it will get much wear. I hope it will hold up over time.

INPUT: My dog loves this toy, I haven&#39;t seen hear more thrill with any other toy, for the first three days, which is how long the squeaker lasted. She is not a heavy chewer, and in one of her &#34;victory walks&#34; after retrieving the ball, the squeaker was already gone. Apart from that it is my best investment

OUTPUT: neutral

INPUT: Quality made from a family business. Sometimes a challenge to move around due to the chew toys hanging off but gives our puppy something to knaw on throughout the night. 5 month update: Our dog doesn&#39;t destroy many toys but since he truly loves this one he has ripped off the head, the tail rope, torn a few corner rope rings, put teeth marks in the internal foam and now ripped the underside of the cover. I&#39;m giving this 4 stars still due to the simple fact that he LOVES this thing. Purchased right before they sold out, maybe the new model is more durable. Update with new model: The newer model has some areas where design has decreased in quality. The &#34;tail&#34; rope is not attached nearly as well as the first one. However, so far nothing has been ripped off of it in the 3 weeks since we have received it. He still loves it though!
OUTPUT: neutral

INPUT: My dog is loving her new toy. She has torn up others very quick, so far so good here. L

OUTPUT: negative

INPUT: We bought it in hopes my son would stop sucking his thumb. He doesn&#39;t suck it when it&#39;s on but when it&#39;s off for eating, bathing, washing hands... he will still do it. We are now going to try the nail polish with bitter taste. This is a good idea, my son just needs something stronger to beat it.
OUTPUT: neutral

INPUT: Had three weeks and corner grommet ripped out
OUTPUT: negative

INPUT: The iron works good, but its very small, almost delicate. The insulation parts on the tip were plastic not ceramic. Came with the plug that&#39;s a bonus. But it took quite a bit longer then most things on amazon to ship. I use it for soldering race drones, i ordered the smaller tip, and its actually to small for all but my micro drones. Had to order another tip. Gets hot pretty quick. Apparently this is a firmware upgrade you can do to make it better, but i didn&#39;t have to use it.

I believe I will buy another one when this one is full!

INPUT: This gets three stars because it did not give me exactly what I ordered. I ordered 4 of the 100 card lots. So, I wanted 100 Unstable MTG cards per box. Instead, I was given 97 Unstable cards per box, and 4 random MTG commons. I paid for 100 Unstable cards! Not 97 and 4 random cards! Also, the boxes they advertise are not too great. They do the job of holding the cards, but that&#39;s about it. I&#39;m definitely getting a new case for these. If you want to buy, don&#39;t take it too seriously. Don&#39;t expect all 100 cards to be Unstable, and expect multiples.

INPUT: I would love to give this product 5 star but unfortunately it just doesn‚Äôt cut due to quality. I bought them only (and only) for my toddlers snacks. And for that purpose they work great. I would probably use them in other situations as well if they were all the same. And yes I understand, if they are hand carved from one piece of wood, there could be slight difference, but that‚Äôs where product quality control comes in. I guess they just didn‚Äôt want any faulty products and decided to sell them all no matter what.

Yes, she really is a typical girl and does not mind the hair dryer at all. I bought this hoping it would absorb enough to get her dry without any additional towels. Did not work for Stella. Now, I am sure it would work for a small dog and is a very nice towel. If you have a small dog, go ahead and get it.

INPUT: I purchased this for my wife in October, 2017. At the time, we were in the middle of relocating and living in a hotel. I couldn&#39;t get this scale to connect to the Wifi in the hotel. I decided to wait until we moved into our home and I could set up my own Wifi system. March 2018- I have set up my Wifi system and this scale still won&#39;t connect. Every time I try, I get the error message. Even when I am 10&#39; away from the Wifi unit. I followed the YouTube setup video with no success. When I purchased the unit, I thought it would connect directly to my wife&#39;s phone (like Bluetooth). Instead, this scale uses the Wifi router to communicate to the phone. This system is limited to the router connection...which is usually not close to the bedroom unlike a cell phone! I wouldn&#39;t recommend this scale to anyone because of the Wifi connection. Instead, please look at systems that use Bluetooth for communication. I am replacing this with a Bluetooth connection scale.

INPUT: Seriously the fluffiest towels! The color is beautiful, exactly as pictured, and they are bigger than I expected. Plus, I spent the same amount of money for these that I would have on the &#34;premium&#34; (non-organic) towels from Wal-Mart. You can&#39;t go wrong.
OUTPUT: positive

INPUT: Ultimately I love the look of the curtains, they are beautiful and provide enough light blocking for the room we&#39;re using them in. However, they are not the color pictured. They were only blue and white. I wish that they were the ones that I thought that I had ordered, however, we will keep them because they are still beautiful.

INPUT: The clear backing lacks the stickiness to keep the letters adhered until you‚Äôre finished weeding! It‚Äôs so frustrating to have to keep up with a bunch of letters and pieces that have curled and fell off the paper!

INPUT: My dog loves this toy, I haven&#39;t seen hear more thrill with any other toy, for the first three days, which is how long the squeaker lasted. She is not a heavy chewer, and in one of her &#34;victory walks&#34; after retrieving the ball, the squeaker was already gone. Apart from that it is my best investment
OUTPUT: neutral

INPUT: I have three of these linked together. As many of the other reviews said, the legs are weak and prone to breakage even with careful use. It is best to provide some other means of support and not use the legs. Also the gaskets at the fittings do not seal well. I used RTV silicone sealant when assembling the water fittings to stop the leakage. These units are doing a good job heating my pool.
OUTPUT: neutral

INPUT: These are great for SO many things. Originally I had them in my drink at a club but then later bought them for my wedding center pieces. The light stays on for weeks but becomes dim after 3 or 4 days. We had a great time leaving the extra ones around the party and will use the extra ones for fun.
OUTPUT: positive

INPUT: Looking at orher reviews the tail was supposed to be obscenely long -- it was actually the perfect size but im not sure if thats intentional. The waist strap fits perfectly-- but again, need to list that my waist is fairly wide and it sat on my hips. Im unsure about the life of the strap. To the actual quality the fur seems of a fair (not great but not terrible quality but the tail isnt fully stuffed.) Apparently theres supposed to be a wire to pose the tail. There is none in mine, which is fine cause again, mine came up shorter than others. Im only rating 3 stars because of some unintentional good things.
OUTPUT: neutral

INPUT: Not super durable. The bag holds up okay but the drawstrings sometimes tear if the bag gets past a couple lbs.
OUTPUT: neutral

INPUT: I can not tell you how many times I have bought one of these. My dogs are obsessed with them! The legs don‚Äôt last long but the rest of it does, probably one of the longer lasting toys they have had.

INPUT: Im not sure if its just this sellers stock of this product or what but the first order was no good, each bottle had mold and clumps in the bottle and usually companies will put a couple of metal beads in a bottle to aid in the mixing but these had a rock in it... like a rock off the ground. I decided to replace the item, same seller, and once again they were all clumpy and gross... I attached a photo. I wouldnt buy these, at least not from this seller.

INPUT: I love how the waist doesn&#39;t have an elastic band in them. I have a bad back and tight waist bands always make my back feel worse.These feel decent...although If they could make them just one size larger..and not just offer plus size....that would be even better for my back.

INPUT: They work really well for heartburn and stomach upset. But taking a couple stars off as capsules are poor quality and break. I lost over 30 in a bottle of 120 as they leaked. Powder ended up bottom of bottle.
OUTPUT: neutral

OUTPUT: negative

INPUT: I love these Capris so much that I bought 4 pairs. The high waist helps with tummy control where I have a lot around the waist but skinnier legs and these are perfect. Sometimes with high waist products they tend to roll but these do not and they make your ass look amazing. Highly recommended.

INPUT: Very strong cheap pleather smell that took a few days to air out. One of the straps clips onto the zipper, so be careful of the zipper slowly coming undone as you walk.
OUTPUT: neutral

INPUT: The 8 year old nephew said he wanted this for his birthday. I felt it was a bit much for a toy but he caught me on a good day. Come to find out it&#39;s a fragile collectible so the nephew lost all the small parts the moment he opened it. I guess it&#39;s adequate for collectors that want detail on such a small figurine.
OUTPUT: neutral

INPUT: It leaves white residue all over dishes! Gross!
OUTPUT: negative

INPUT: Really can&#39;t say because cat refused to try it. I gave it to someone else to try
OUTPUT: negative

INPUT: Wouldn‚Äôt keep air the first day of use!!!
OUTPUT: negative

INPUT: Way to sensitive turns on and off 1000 times a night I guess it picks up bugs or something
OUTPUT: negative

INPUT: Smudges easily and collects in corners of eyes throughout the day. Goes on smooth and rich without clumping.
OUTPUT: neutral

INPUT: I really love this product. I love how big it is compare to others diaper changing pads. I love the extra pockets and on top of that you get a free insulated bottle bag. All of that for an amazing price.

INPUT: I REALLY WANTED TO LOVE THIS BUT I DON&#39;T. THE SMELL IS NOT STRONG AT ALL NO MATTER HOW MUCH OF IT ADD.

INPUT: I like these storage bins overall. The color of the lining inside wasn‚Äôt expected, it shows a light brown color in the photo but it‚Äôs pretty dark. I would have preferred the lining inside to match the outside, tan or grey. Other than that they are cute and look as pictured.

INPUT: Does not work mixed this with process solution and 000 and nothing. Looked exactly the same as i first put it on.
OUTPUT: negative

INPUT: This is a knock off product. This IS NOT a puddle jumper brand float but a flimsy knock off instead. It is missing all stearns and puddle jumper branding on the arms. Do not buy!
OUTPUT: negative

INPUT: Had to use washers even though the bolts were stock like beveled in appearance. 3 pulled through the skid, and there isn&#39;t any rust issues. I called daystar because i spent the money so i wouldn&#39;t have to use washers. They told me to use washers.
OUTPUT: neutral

INPUT: I have this installed under my spa cover to help maintain the heat. My spa is fully electric (including the heater), and this has done a good job reducing my overall electric bill by about 15% - 20% each month since last November. Quality is holding up fine, but it&#39;s out of the sun since it&#39;s under the spa cover. (Sorry, can&#39;t comment on what the longevity would be in the full sun.)
OUTPUT: positive

INPUT: This product worked just as designed and was very easy to install.The setup is so simple for each load on the trailer.I would def recommend this item for anyone needing a break controller.
OUTPUT: positive

INPUT: These are awesome! I just used them on my 12 ft Christmas tree so I could get it out the door. So easy to use that I‚Äôm going to buy another pair.
OUTPUT: positive

INPUT: Once installed we realized that it&#39;s missing a gasket or something behind it to seal it to the shower wall. Water can just run behind it because it doesn&#39;t fit tightly. It looks great and I like it, but we have to figure something out to make it more functional.
OUTPUT: neutral

INPUT: This product does not work at all. I have tried it on two of my vehicles and it does not cover light scratches. Waste of money.
OUTPUT: negative

INPUT: I was very disappointed in this item. It is very soft and not chewy. It falls apart in your hand. My dog eats them but I prefer a more chewy treat for my dog.
OUTPUT: negative

INPUT: Just can&#39;t get use to the lack of taste with this ceylon cinnamon. I have to use so much to get any taste at all. This is the first ceylon I&#39;ve tried so I can&#39;t compare. Just not impressed. I agree with some others that it taste more like red hot candy smells. Hope I can find some that has some flavor. I really don&#39;t want to go back to the other cinnamon that is bad for us.

INPUT: I like everything about the pill box except its size. I take a lot of supplements and the dispenser is just too small to hold all the pills that I take.

INPUT: It is really nice to have my favorite sugar alternative packaged in little take along packets! I LOVE swerve, and it is so convenient to have these to throw in my purse for dining out, or to use at a friend‚Äôs house. While they are a bit pricey, I cannot stand Equal or the pink stuff in my iced tea. Swerve or nothing, so i am thrilled to have my sweetener on the go!

INPUT: I like these storage bins overall. The color of the lining inside wasn‚Äôt expected, it shows a light brown color in the photo but it‚Äôs pretty dark. I would have preferred the lining inside to match the outside, tan or grey. Other than that they are cute and look as pictured.
OUTPUT: neutral

INPUT: I was very disappointed in this item. It is very soft and not chewy. It falls apart in your hand. My dog eats them but I prefer a more chewy treat for my dog.

INPUT: We bring the kid to Cape Cod this long weekend. The shelter is very helpful when we stay on the beach. Kid feel comfortable when she was in the shelter. It was cool inside of shelter especially if you put some water on the top of the shelter. It is also very easy to carry and set up. It is a good product with high quality.

INPUT: The 8 year old nephew said he wanted this for his birthday. I felt it was a bit much for a toy but he caught me on a good day. Come to find out it&#39;s a fragile collectible so the nephew lost all the small parts the moment he opened it. I guess it&#39;s adequate for collectors that want detail on such a small figurine.

INPUT: After I gave it to my pet bunny, she didn&#39;t like it as much.
OUTPUT: neutral

INPUT: It&#39;s an ok bin. I got it to use as a clothes hamper thinking it was more of a linen material, probably my mistake for not reading the description better but it&#39;s actually more like a plastic. Decided it would be better suited for my daughter&#39;s stuff animals. It&#39;s cute and serves a purpose and isn&#39;t all that expensive. Just not what I thought it would be when originally purchasing it.

INPUT: I did a lot of thinking as I read this book. I felt as though I could really picture what the main character was going through. The author did a great job describing the situations and events. I really rooted for the main character and felt her struggles. It seems as though she had to over come a lot to once again over come a lot. She had a group of interesting characters both supporting her and also ones who were against her. Not a plot to be predicted. I highly recommend this book. It grabbed my attention from the first page and had me thinking about it long after. I look forward to reading the author&#39;s next book.

OUTPUT: neutral

INPUT: The book is very informative, with great tips and tricks about how to travel as well as what the locations are about which is both it&#39;s good and bad aspect. It gives so much interesting context, it may be overly insightful. For the person who must know everything, this is great. For the person who has no idea. Googling will suffice.

INPUT: It worked for a week. My husband loved it. And then all of the sudden it won&#39;t charge or turn on. It just stopped working.
OUTPUT: negative

INPUT: I saw this and thought it would be good to store the myriad of batts that I have. You must know that this is made to hang on the wall. The lid does not lock down in any way it just hangs lose and bangs into the Size C batts. You can lay it flat but remember the lid does not in any way hold the batteries from falling out if you turn it to the side, Now for me the biggest disappointment is that there are no slots for the batteries that use the most, the CR 123 batts. I rate it just barely useful. I should have read more carefully the description. It is too much trouble to return it so I&#39;ll keep it and buy smaller cases with locking lids
OUTPUT: neutral

INPUT: Quality is just okay. Magnet on the back is strong and it&#39;s nice its detachable but the case around the phone isn&#39;t very protective and very flimsy. You get what you pay for.
OUTPUT: neutral

INPUT: This is the second one of these that I have purchased. It is an excellent platform for a foam or conventional mattress. It is totally sturdy, and looks nice. I highly recommend it. There are many frames out there that will cost you much more, but this does the trick.
OUTPUT: positive

INPUT: These little lights are awesome. They put off a nice amount of light. And you can put them ANYWHERE! I have put one in the pantry. Another in my linen closet. Another one right next to my bed for when I get up in the middle of the night. Have only had them about a month but so far so good!

OUTPUT: neutral

INPUT: Great hold and strength on the magnet. Can be easily maneuvered to fit your needs for holding curtains back.
OUTPUT: positive

INPUT: I have this installed under my spa cover to help maintain the heat. My spa is fully electric (including the heater), and this has done a good job reducing my overall electric bill by about 15% - 20% each month since last November. Quality is holding up fine, but it&#39;s out of the sun since it&#39;s under the spa cover. (Sorry, can&#39;t comment on what the longevity would be in the full sun.)
OUTPUT: positive

INPUT: Bought this item not even three months ago and am already starting to have problems. The steal slates to support the mattress (as advertised NO BOX SPRING NEEDED) does in fact need that extra layer of support. I am currently using about 7 blankets underneath my mattress for support. However my bed does stay in place, there is storage underneath like I needed and all around is a good product. But if you do plan on buying this item make sure you have the extra support for your mattress!!!

They did not seem to have any effect on him one way or another , other than the fact that he didn&#39;t like them and didn&#39;t want to eat them. I ended up throwing them away. Money down the drain.

I&#39;m sure they&#39;re fine if you&#39;re very careful with them, but if whatever you&#39;re charging falls off a table or nightstand while plugged in, these are very likely to stop working quickly.
OUTPUT: negative

INPUT: So pretty...but the first time I unplugged it, the glass top came off of the base. There‚Äôs a plastic ring attached to the bottom of the glass part. It has notches - supposedly to allow you to twist it onto the nightlight base. You‚Äôd need to be able to do that in order to replace the bulb. I‚Äôll try gorilla glue or something to see if the ring can be securely affixed to the glass. Surprisingly poor design for something so beautiful.

INPUT: Looks good. Clasp some times does not lock completely and the watch falls off. One time it fell off and the back cover popped off. I do get lots of compliments of color combination.
OUTPUT: neutral

INPUT: These make it really easy to use your small keyboard on your phone. Would recommend to everyone.
OUTPUT: positive

INPUT: So far my daughter loves it. She uses it for school backpack. As far as durable, we just got it, so we will have to see.
OUTPUT: positive

INPUT: I like these storage bins overall. The color of the lining inside wasn‚Äôt expected, it shows a light brown color in the photo but it‚Äôs pretty dark. I would have preferred the lining inside to match the outside, tan or grey. Other than that they are cute and look as pictured.
OUTPUT: neutral

OUTPUT: positive

INPUT: Cheap material. Broke after a couple month of usage and I emailed the company about it and never got a response. There are much better phone cases out there so don&#39;t waste your time with this one.
OUTPUT: negative

INPUT: Works very well. Easy to set alarms, and time. The snooze/backlight function is pretty neat too. The dim back light is also nice so that you can actually read the time in the dark.
OUTPUT: positive

INPUT: The quality is meh!! (treads are hanging out from places), however the colors are not the same (as seen on the display) :(
OUTPUT: neutral

INPUT: It‚Äôs ok, buttons are kind of confusing and after 4 months the power button is stuck and we can no longer turn it on or off. Sorta disappointed in this purchase.
OUTPUT: neutral

INPUT: This case is ok, but not exceptional - a 3.5 or 4 max. The issue is there are fewer cases available for the Tab A 10.1 w S pen. Of those the Gumdrop is about the best, but it has some serious issues. The case rubber (silicone, whatever) is very smooth and slick, and doesn&#39;t give you a lot of confidence when hold the Tab with one hand. The Tab A is heavy so if your laying down watching a video the case slips in your hand so you have to make frequent adjustments. I had to remove the clear plastic shield that covers the screen because it impaired the touch screen operation. This affected the strength of the 1-piece plastic frame the surrounds the Tab A, so now the rubber outer cover feels really flexible and flimsy. Lastly, they made it difficult to get to the S pen. The S pen is in the back bottom right hand corner of the Tab A, and they made the little rubber flap that protects corner swing backwards for access to the S pen. This means in order to get the S pen out, the flap has to swing out 180 degrees. This is really awkward and hard to do with one hand. This case does a good job protecting my Tab A, but with these serious design flaws I can&#39;t recommend it unless you have an S pen, then you don&#39;t have much choice.
OUTPUT: neutral

INPUT: Perfect color and really cool lighted keyboard, but it dents really easily just being in a backpack as we&#39;ve only used it like 2 weeks and it&#39;s already dented. No instructions given to set up bluetooth or change lighted keyboard options or brightness. Had to look up how to do such using previous customer reviews (from their calls to customer service). Expected it to be more durable for a forty-five dollar+ case. Disappointed it dents so easily.

INPUT: I purchased this for my wife in October, 2017. At the time, we were in the middle of relocating and living in a hotel. I couldn&#39;t get this scale to connect to the Wifi in the hotel. I decided to wait until we moved into our home and I could set up my own Wifi system. March 2018- I have set up my Wifi system and this scale still won&#39;t connect. Every time I try, I get the error message. Even when I am 10&#39; away from the Wifi unit. I followed the YouTube setup video with no success. When I purchased the unit, I thought it would connect directly to my wife&#39;s phone (like Bluetooth). Instead, this scale uses the Wifi router to communicate to the phone. This system is limited to the router connection...which is usually not close to the bedroom unlike a cell phone! I wouldn&#39;t recommend this scale to anyone because of the Wifi connection. Instead, please look at systems that use Bluetooth for communication. I am replacing this with a Bluetooth connection scale.

INPUT: For the money, it&#39;s a good buy... but the fingerprint ID just doesn&#39;t work very good. After several attempts, it would not allow me to register my fingerprint. So... I just use the key to lock and unlock the safe, and that&#39;s not a problem. If you want something with the ability to open with your fingerprint, you&#39;ll need to spend a bit more, but if fingerprint id isn&#39;t something you absolutely need to have, then this safe is for you.

Big boot footprints were on two boxes, a big hole in another and all of them were crushed pretty good.

INPUT: Looking at orher reviews the tail was supposed to be obscenely long -- it was actually the perfect size but im not sure if thats intentional. The waist strap fits perfectly-- but again, need to list that my waist is fairly wide and it sat on my hips. Im unsure about the life of the strap. To the actual quality the fur seems of a fair (not great but not terrible quality but the tail isnt fully stuffed.) Apparently theres supposed to be a wire to pose the tail. There is none in mine, which is fine cause again, mine came up shorter than others. Im only rating 3 stars because of some unintentional good things.
OUTPUT: neutral

INPUT: I love how the waist doesn&#39;t have an elastic band in them. I have a bad back and tight waist bands always make my back feel worse.These feel decent...although If they could make them just one size larger..and not just offer plus size....that would be even better for my back.

OUTPUT: positive

INPUT: Quality made from a family business. Sometimes a challenge to move around due to the chew toys hanging off but gives our puppy something to knaw on throughout the night. 5 month update: Our dog doesn&#39;t destroy many toys but since he truly loves this one he has ripped off the head, the tail rope, torn a few corner rope rings, put teeth marks in the internal foam and now ripped the underside of the cover. I&#39;m giving this 4 stars still due to the simple fact that he LOVES this thing. Purchased right before they sold out, maybe the new model is more durable. Update with new model: The newer model has some areas where design has decreased in quality. The &#34;tail&#34; rope is not attached nearly as well as the first one. However, so far nothing has been ripped off of it in the 3 weeks since we have received it. He still loves it though!

I hate it I think it&#39;s more or less the design of the applicator I don&#39;t really like the fatness of it I really like to sleep slim ones that to me they really stimulate your clit a whole lot better but hey that&#39;s just my opinion I went by it again that we looking for alternative hope this helps anybody on the quest to find a good bullet LOL LOL

Seller advised to use a hair dryer to flatten out the wrinkles, but it was a very painstakingly slow process that only took some of the sharp edges off of the folds, didn&#39;t make much difference. Going to invest in something better (and much more expensive) for daily use, this is OK for what it does.

OUTPUT: positive

INPUT: Looking at orher reviews the tail was supposed to be obscenely long -- it was actually the perfect size but im not sure if thats intentional. The waist strap fits perfectly-- but again, need to list that my waist is fairly wide and it sat on my hips. Im unsure about the life of the strap. To the actual quality the fur seems of a fair (not great but not terrible quality but the tail isnt fully stuffed.) Apparently theres supposed to be a wire to pose the tail. There is none in mine, which is fine cause again, mine came up shorter than others. Im only rating 3 stars because of some unintentional good things.

Good purchase overall and I love the dark blue color. I only miss the night light, which this one does not have
OUTPUT: positive

INPUT: This watch was purchased in mid-June. Not even 2 months later it&#39;s losing 45 minutes every 4 hours. The indicator boasts a &#34;full charge&#34; but still, losing &gt;10 minutes every hour - faulty. Amazon&#39;s customer service was A COMPLETE JOKE. I was on the line for over ten minutes (probably longer but my watch runs slow), and got nowhere. Out of warranty.

INPUT: I would love to give this product 5 star but unfortunately it just doesn‚Äôt cut due to quality. I bought them only (and only) for my toddlers snacks. And for that purpose they work great. I would probably use them in other situations as well if they were all the same.

INPUT: 3 1/2 Stars Remedy is a brothers best friend romance as well as a second chance romance mixed into one. It&#39;s a unique story, and the hero (Grady) has to do everything to get Collins back and prove he&#39;s the guy for her. Three years ago, Grady and Collins had an amazing night together. Collins thought she was finally getting everything she dreamed of, her brothers best friend... but when she woke up alone the next morning, and never heard from her, things definitely changed. Now Grady is back, and he&#39;s not leaving, and he&#39;s doing everything in his power to prove to her why he left, and that he&#39;s not giving her up this time around. While I loved the premise of this story, and at times Grady, he really got on my nerves. I totally understand his reasoning for leaving that night, but to not even send a letter to Collins explaining himself? To leave her wondering and hurt for all those years, and then expect her to welcome him back with open arms? Was he delusional?! Collins was right to be upset, angry, hurt, etc. She was right to put up a fight with him when he wanted her back and to move forward. I admire her will power, because Grady was persistent. I loved Collins in this book, she was strong, and she guarded her heart, and I admired her for that. Sure she loved Grady, but she was scared, and hesitant to let him back in her life, who wouldn&#39;t be after what he did to her? Her character was definitely my favorite out of the two. She definitely let things go at the pace she wanted, and when she was ready to listen, she listened. There is a lot of angst in this book, and I did enjoy watching these two reconnect when Collins started to forgive Grady, I just wish Grady would have not come off as so whiney and would have been a little more understanding. He kept saying he understood, but at times he was a little too pushy to me, and then he was sweet towards the end. I ended up loving him just as much as Collins, but in the beginning of the book, I had a hard time reading his points of view because I couldn&#39;t connect with his character. The first part of this book, was not my favorite, but he second part? I adored, hence my rating. If you like second chance, and brothers best friend romances, you may really enjoy this book, I just had a hard time with Grady at first and how he handled some of the things he did.

INPUT: I like this series. The main characters are unusual and very damaged from a terrible childhood. Will is an excellent investigator but due to a disability he believes he is illiterate. Slaughter does a very good job showing how people with dyslexia learn ways to hide their limitations. It will be interesting to see how these characters play out in the future. I understand that Slaughter brings some of the characters from the Grant County series to this series. The crimes are brutal. I&#39;m sure this is a good representation of what police come across in their career. The procedural is well done and kept me interested from start to finish. I&#39;m looking forward to reading more of this series soon.

INPUT: I use these cartridges all the time, but this is my first time to order them from Amazon (I had a gift card on Amazon that needed to be used). The box which, actually, was shipped from Office Depot was damaged when it arrived; however, the cartridges appear not to be damaged. I&#39;ll find out for sure when I install them (not all at the same time). An interesting thing about my order: I wanted a box of 2 black cartridges, also, but there was a delivery charge on them because the order would be fulfilled by Office Depot - there was free shipping on the color cartridges (fulfilled by Amazon). Rather than pay shipping on the black cartridges, I bought them at the local Walmart for the same price as through Amazon -- no shipping charges. The interesting thing was that when the color cartridges arrived, they had been shipped by Office Depot -- no shipping charges on them. Why shipping charges on black but not color -- price on each was more than the $25 amount required for free shipping and both shipped from Office Depot? Doesn&#39;t make sense to me.

INPUT: These little lights are awesome. They put off a nice amount of light. And you can put them ANYWHERE! I have put one in the pantry. Another in my linen closet. Another one right next to my bed for when I get up in the middle of the night. Have only had them about a month but so far so good!

INPUT: What a really great set of acrylics. My daughter has been painting with them since they came in. The colors come in a wide range of vibrant colors that have a smooth consistency. These paints are packed in aluminum tubes which allows the paint to not dry or crack over time.
OUTPUT: positive

INPUT: I didn‚Äôt like that it was made out of plastic and that you had to put it together yourself.
OUTPUT: negative

INPUT: Im not sure if its just this sellers stock of this product or what but the first order was no good, each bottle had mold and clumps in the bottle and usually companies will put a couple of metal beads in a bottle to aid in the mixing but these had a rock in it... like a rock off the ground. I decided to replace the item, same seller, and once again they were all clumpy and gross... I attached a photo. I wouldnt buy these, at least not from this seller.
OUTPUT: negative

INPUT: Expensive for a kids soap
OUTPUT: neutral

INPUT: I would love to give this product 5 star but unfortunately it just doesn‚Äôt cut due to quality. I bought them only (and only) for my toddlers snacks. And for that purpose they work great. I would probably use them in other situations as well if they were all the same. And yes I understand, if they are hand carved from one piece of wood, there could be slight difference, but that‚Äôs where product quality control comes in. I guess they just didn‚Äôt want any faulty products and decided to sell them all no matter what.

INPUT: This was not like the name brand polymer clays I am used to working with. This is much to plasticky feeling, hard to work with, it won‚Äôt soften up even the slightest bit with the heat from my hands like the name brand polymers. It was difficult to mold, roll, and impossible to create anything halfway decent looking. This is certainly a case of ‚Äúyou get what you pay for‚Äù Stick to the name brand if you want this for anything other than for a kid to mess around with. I am highly disappointed in everything except for the case it came in.

INPUT: There are no pockets for organization inside this bag. There are flat divided areas on the outside but not convenient. The material is good and has been durable thus far.
OUTPUT: neutral

INPUT: Overall I liked the phone especially for the price. The durability is my main issue I dropped the phone once onto a wood floor from about 12 inches and the screen cracked after having it for about 2 weeks. Otherwise it seemed to be a decent phone. It had a few little quirks that took a little getting used to but otherwise I think it wood be a good phone if it was more durable.
OUTPUT: neutral

INPUT: Too stiff, barely zips, and is very bulky
OUTPUT: negative

INPUT: I love how the waist doesn&#39;t have an elastic band in them. I have a bad back and tight waist bands always make my back feel worse.These feel decent...although If they could make them just one size larger..and not just offer plus size....that would be even better for my back.
OUTPUT: positive

INPUT: It will do the job of holding shoes. It&#39;s not glamorous, but it holds shoes and stands in a closet. You will need help with the shelving assembly as it is a two person job.
OUTPUT: neutral

INPUT: Upsetting...these only work if you have a thin phone and or no phone case at all. I&#39;m not going to take my phone&#39;s case (which isn&#39;t thick) off Everytime I want to use the stand. Wast of money. Don&#39;t buy if you use a phone case to protect your phone it&#39;s too thin.
OUTPUT: negative

INPUT: I really love this product. I love how big it is compare to others diaper changing pads. I love the extra pockets and on top of that you get a free insulated bottle bag. All of that for an amazing price.
OUTPUT: positive

INPUT: Not super durable. The bag holds up okay but the drawstrings sometimes tear if the bag gets past a couple lbs.
OUTPUT: neutral

OUTPUT: neutral

INPUT: All the pockets and functionality are just right. I can&#39;t really find anything about the usability that annoys me such as pockets or organization not quite right. The pockets are placed and sized well and I find them all useful. The most annoying thing about it is that it does not stand up straight on its own, however, it has a very predictable side that it falls to. It leans predictably so it is not an actual issue against it&#39;s overall usability.

INPUT: This dress is very comfortable. I would recommend wearing a slip under it as it is very thin. I‚Äôm going to have to hem the bottom because it‚Äôs long. I‚Äôm 5‚Äô5‚Äù and even in wedges it hits the floor. But it‚Äôs great for the price!
OUTPUT: positive

INPUT: Fantastic belt ,love it . This is my second one , the first one was a little small but this one is perfect. I suggest you order one size bigger than your waist size.
OUTPUT: negative

INPUT: This shirt is not long as the picture indicates. It&#39;s just below waist length. Disappointed b/c I am 5&#39;10 and wanted to wear with leggings.
OUTPUT: negative

INPUT: The black one with the tassels on the front and it looks pretty cute, perfect for summer. I have broad shoulders so the looseness was great for me but if you are more petit you might not love how oversized it can look (specially the sleeves). Please note, it does SHRINK after washing (not even drying) so beware!! Also, it is very short but cute nonetheless.
OUTPUT: neutral

INPUT: It was recommended by a friend and found that things are really good to wear and I like them very much.
OUTPUT: positive

INPUT: Really cute outfit and fit well. But, the two bows fell off the top the first time worn. The bows were glued on opposed to sewn.
OUTPUT: neutral

INPUT: I didn&#39;t really have high hopes for this dress as I was expecting more of a costume-like dress, but I pleasantly was surprised! It is really cute and the fabric is thicker than I was expecting which is nice. It is a little tight around the neck and the zipper does not seem to be the strongest, but I got several complements and would highly recommend this dress!
OUTPUT: positive

INPUT: Looking at orher reviews the tail was supposed to be obscenely long -- it was actually the perfect size but im not sure if thats intentional. The waist strap fits perfectly-- but again, need to list that my waist is fairly wide and it sat on my hips. Im unsure about the life of the strap. To the actual quality the fur seems of a fair (not great but not terrible quality but the tail isnt fully stuffed.) Apparently theres supposed to be a wire to pose the tail. There is none in mine, which is fine cause again, mine came up shorter than others. Im only rating 3 stars because of some unintentional good things.
OUTPUT: neutral

INPUT: Terrific fabric and fit through belly, hips and thighs, but apparently these should be worn with 3&#34; heels, which is ridiculous for exercise/loungewear. (Yes I&#39;m being sarcastic.) Seriously: these were at least 4&#34; too long to be comfortable (let alone safe to walk in). Back they go, and I won&#39;t try again.
OUTPUT: neutral

INPUT: This is even sexier than the pic! It has good control and is smooth under all my clothes! It&#39;s also comfortable and I&#39;m able to easily wear it all day, it doesn&#39;t roll down either!
OUTPUT: positive

INPUT: Nice lightweight material without being cheap feeling. Generally the design is nice, except the waist. The sewn in waist band is high. If you are long waisted , it would be way above your waist. I am a medium which is what I ordered. The waistband is about at the last rib in the front. When you tie the attached belt there is an improvement. OK as a house dress for me. I&#39;m 5&#39;4&#34; and it&#39;s bit bit long. I just knotted the corners of the bottom hem...that works.

The durability is my main issue I dropped the phone once onto a wood floor from about 12 inches and the screen cracked after having it for about 2 weeks. Otherwise it seemed to be a decent phone. It had a few little quirks that took a little getting used to but otherwise I think it wood be a good phone if it was more durable.

INPUT: For the S3 Gold: Color matches perfectly, but the band I received is not the same quality as the other BRG bands I‚Äôve bought. The middle metal clasp that attaches to the watch is extremely loose. The entire clasp that slides into the watch is also loose and wiggles. The magnetic clasp to lock the bracelet in place also slides off easily. I love that the color matches, but I either got a defective band or the quality has gone down.
OUTPUT: negative

INPUT: few cables not working, please reply what to do?
OUTPUT: neutral

INPUT: This cable is not of very good quality. It doesn‚Äôt fit right so you have to hold the connector to the port in order to work.
OUTPUT: negative

INPUT: Not enough information and it seems to behave erratically. Not contacted Tech Support yet. Support URL in printed instructions is dead. Needs better instructions for VOIP POTS without cordless phones in home. I am somewhat allergic to radios. Literature does not tell what to expect when CPR Call blocker is disconnected for short period of time. It depends entirely on talk line battery. I need it to work and am not giving up. Tech support seems to be illusive.
OUTPUT: neutral

INPUT: Had some problems getting it to work. The supplied cable was no good - would not charge the battery. When I replaced cable with my own was able to charge and then connect the device via bluetooth to a PC. Had trouble finding the PC software but when I emailed their support they responded within a day with the correct download info. PC program works well for testing the unit after you figure out which port to use (port 4 in my case). The accuracy and stability of the unit look very good for my application, however I was not able to connect to either an iPhone or iPad (tried several of each) via bluetooth. Will have to hard-wire if I decide to use this device in my product.

INPUT: These are very fragile. I have a cat who is a bit rambunctious and sometimes knocks my phone off my nightstand while it&#39;s plugged in. He managed to break all of these the first or second time he did that.

I have another Anker Powerline 1 cable and it has been great. Not sure how the II can go backwards. My window to return has closed so I guess I&#39;ll contact them directly and see if they will replace with a different cable.

INPUT: I bought this modem/router about two years ago. At the start it seemed to be ok but for the last year plus I‚Äôve had problems with it dropping the internet. This happens on all my devices both Wi-Fi and wired. The only way to restore service was to do a AC power reset. This was happening once or twice a day. Comcast came out, ran a new coax line from the pedestal to the house and boosted the signal level. Same problem. The Arris Tech guys were great but could not solve the problem. Additionally, I lost the 5G service on three occasions. I had to do a factory reset to restore this. I cannot recommend this modem/router based upon my experiences. I purchased a Netgear AC1900 modem/router. It‚Äôs fantastic. I‚Äôv Had it for over a week with no problems. It‚Äôs faster and the range is greater than the Arris. I read online that other people have had problems with the Arris modem/router connected to Comcast. If you have Comcast internet I do not recommend this Arris modem/router. Get the Netgear, its much more reliable.

Sometimes a challenge to move around due to the chew toys hanging off but gives our puppy something to knaw on throughout the night. 5 month update: Our dog doesn&#39;t destroy many toys but since he truly loves this one he has ripped off the head, the tail rope, torn a few corner rope rings, put teeth marks in the internal foam and now ripped the underside of the cover. I&#39;m giving this 4 stars still due to the simple fact that he LOVES this thing. Purchased right before they sold out, maybe the new model is more durable. Update with new model: The newer model has some areas where design has decreased in quality. The &#34;tail&#34; rope is not attached nearly as well as the first one. However, so far nothing has been ripped off of it in the 3 weeks since we have received it. He still loves it though!

INPUT: This case is ok, but not exceptional - a 3.5 or 4 max. The issue is there are fewer cases available for the Tab A 10.1 w S pen. Of those the Gumdrop is about the best, but it has some serious issues. The case rubber (silicone, whatever) is very smooth and slick, and doesn&#39;t give you a lot of confidence when hold the Tab with one hand. The Tab A is heavy so if your laying down watching a video the case slips in your hand so you have to make frequent adjustments. I had to remove the clear plastic shield that covers the screen because it impaired the touch screen operation. This affected the strength of the 1-piece plastic frame the surrounds the Tab A, so now the rubber outer cover feels really flexible and flimsy. Lastly, they made it difficult to get to the S pen. The S pen is in the back bottom right hand corner of the Tab A, and they made the little rubber flap that protects corner swing backwards for access to the S pen. This means in order to get the S pen out, the flap has to swing out 180 degrees. This is really awkward and hard to do with one hand.

INPUT: I am returning product, I‚Äôve been getting the same Wella Brilliance shampoo for years...the darker and cheaper one circled, and the last Two deliveries were the lighter bottle which smells nothing like the product I want and have been using for nearly 10 years. Extremely dissatisfied, why would they have two products and two prices and send the one you DONT PICK????

INPUT: For the S3 Gold: Color matches perfectly, but the band I received is not the same quality as the other BRG bands I‚Äôve bought. The middle metal clasp that attaches to the watch is extremely loose. The entire clasp that slides into the watch is also loose and wiggles. The magnetic clasp to lock the bracelet in place also slides off easily. I love that the color matches, but I either got a defective band or the quality has gone down.

INPUT: You want an HONEST answer? I just returned from UPS where I returned the FARCE of an earring set to Amazon. It did NOT look like what I saw on Amazon. Only a baby would be able to wear the size of the earring. They were SO small. the size of a pin head I at first thought Amazon had forgotten to enclose them in the bag! I didn&#39;t bother to take them out of the bag and you can have them back. Will NEVER order another thing from your company. A disgrace. Honest enough for you? Grandma

INPUT: Adding a review post 1 year of ownership. Mediocre quality. My daughter has been riding the bike to school and back for about a year. The headset (where the handlebar connects) requires re-tightening every few months. The brakes are a weak spot on this bicycle, they are finicky to adjust and need readjustment every month. The shifting system works as you&#39;d expect for a $200 bicycle, clicks into gear but is not smooth. We haven&#39;t experience any of the chain issues some others have mentioned. Lastly, I&#39;m disappointed in the quality of the bolts/nuts used on the bike, the frame itself and most of the components seem to be of decent quality, but the bolts had surface rust after the first winter (and we live in california so we rarely even have rain, just typical morning dew).

INPUT: Seriously the fluffiest towels! The color is beautiful, exactly as pictured, and they are bigger than I expected. Plus, I spent the same amount of money for these that I would have on the &#34;premium&#34; (non-organic) towels from Wal-Mart. You can&#39;t go wrong.

If I wanted Golds Gym, I would have bought these from Walmart. I have a complete set of CAP dumbbells, with the exception of my one set from Golds Gym. Is the weight correct, yes. Due they perform, yes. I just expect to get what I paid for not something else. After reading a few other reviews, I see that others have had the same issue.

OUTPUT: neutral

INPUT: This case is ok, but not exceptional - a 3.5 or 4 max. The issue is there are fewer cases available for the Tab A 10.1 w S pen. Of those the Gumdrop is about the best, but it has some serious issues. The case rubber (silicone, whatever) is very smooth and slick, and doesn&#39;t give you a lot of confidence when hold the Tab with one hand. The Tab A is heavy so if your laying down watching a video the case slips in your hand so you have to make frequent adjustments. I had to remove the clear plastic shield that covers the screen because it impaired the touch screen operation. This affected the strength of the 1-piece plastic frame the surrounds the Tab A, so now the rubber outer cover feels really flexible and flimsy. Lastly, they made it difficult to get to the S pen. The S pen is in the back bottom right hand corner of the Tab A, and they made the little rubber flap that protects corner swing backwards for access to the S pen. This means in order to get the S pen out, the flap has to swing out 180 degrees. This is really awkward and hard to do with one hand. This case does a good job protecting my Tab A, but with these serious design flaws I can&#39;t recommend it unless you have an S pen, then you don&#39;t have much choice.

Needs better instructions for VOIP POTS without cordless phones in home. I am somewhat allergic to radios. Literature does not tell what to expect when CPR Call blocker is disconnected for short period of time. It depends entirely on talk line battery. I need it to work and am not giving up.

INPUT: Overall I liked the phone especially for the price. The durability is my main issue I dropped the phone once onto a wood floor from about 12 inches and the screen cracked after having it for about 2 weeks. Otherwise it seemed to be a decent phone. It had a few little quirks that took a little getting used to but otherwise I think it wood be a good phone if it was more durable.

Happy shopping!

INPUT: The battery life is terrible compared to earlier versions, an all day reading episode uses it up. It is not something I could count on for a long trip without power nearby. Also, it often goes back several pages quickly because my hand gets near the left edge. I regret buying this version.

INPUT: I saw this and thought it would be good to store the myriad of batts that I have. You must know that this is made to hang on the wall. The lid does not lock down in any way it just hangs lose and bangs into the Size C batts. You can lay it flat but remember the lid does not in any way hold the batteries from falling out if you turn it to the side, Now for me the biggest disappointment is that there are no slots for the batteries that use the most, the CR 123 batts. I rate it just barely useful. I should have read more carefully the description. It is too much trouble to return it so I&#39;ll keep it and buy smaller cases with locking lids

INPUT: I hate to give this product one star when it probably deserves 5. My dog has chronic itchy skin and I had high hopes that this product would be the answer to his skin issues.

I crumbled just one up in his food but he was onto me and wouldn&#39;t touch it. So, sadly, the search continues.

INPUT: The book is very informative, with great tips and tricks about how to travel as well as what the locations are about which is both it&#39;s good and bad aspect.

INPUT: I like this series. The main characters are unusual and very damaged from a terrible childhood. Will is an excellent investigator but due to a disability he believes he is illiterate. Slaughter does a very good job showing how people with dyslexia learn ways to hide their limitations. It will be interesting to see how these characters play out in the future. I understand that Slaughter brings some of the characters from the Grant County series to this series. The crimes are brutal. I&#39;m sure this is a good representation of what police come across in their career. The procedural is well done and kept me interested from start to finish. I&#39;m looking forward to reading more of this series soon.

INPUT: Quality made from a family business. Sometimes a challenge to move around due to the chew toys hanging off but gives our puppy something to knaw on throughout the night. 5 month update: Our dog doesn&#39;t destroy many toys but since he truly loves this one he has ripped off the head, the tail rope, torn a few corner rope rings, put teeth marks in the internal foam and now ripped the underside of the cover. I&#39;m giving this 4 stars still due to the simple fact that he LOVES this thing. Purchased right before they sold out, maybe the new model is more durable. Update with new model: The newer model has some areas where design has decreased in quality. The &#34;tail&#34; rope is not attached nearly as well as the first one. However, so far nothing has been ripped off of it in the 3 weeks since we have received it. He still loves it though!

INPUT: Looking at orher reviews the tail was supposed to be obscenely long -- it was actually the perfect size but im not sure if thats intentional. The waist strap fits perfectly-- but again, need to list that my waist is fairly wide and it sat on my hips. Im unsure about the life of the strap. To the actual quality the fur seems of a fair (not great but not terrible quality but the tail isnt fully stuffed.) Apparently theres supposed to be a wire to pose the tail. There is none in mine, which is fine cause again, mine came up shorter than others. Im only rating 3 stars because of some unintentional good things.
OUTPUT: neutral

INPUT: Great idea! My nose is always cold and I can&#39;t fall asleep when it is cold, but for some reason this isn&#39;t keeping my nose warm.
OUTPUT: neutral

INPUT: I bought the tie-dyed version and it was SO comfortable. Stretchy breathable material. I decided to buy the black version for work. Bad decision! The material is completely different. It doesn‚Äôt stretch, it‚Äôs not breathable and it is very small and uncomfortable! It even seems it‚Äôs stitched differently so that it coveres 50% less of my head. So disappointing!!
OUTPUT: negative

INPUT: Very strong cheap pleather smell that took a few days to air out. One of the straps clips onto the zipper, so be careful of the zipper slowly coming undone as you walk.

INPUT: As a hard shell jacket, it‚Äôs pretty good. I ordered the extra large for a skiing trip. It comes small so order a size bigger then normal. I can not use the fleece liner because it is too small. The hard shell is not water proof. I live in the Pacific Northwest and this is not enough to keep you dry. I really like the look of this jacket too.

INPUT: Ordered two identical rolls. One arrived with the vacuum bag having a large hole poked in the center - almost the size of the center hub hole. Since the roll arrives in a product box the hole either occurred before boxing at the manufacturer or I received a return. The seller responded promptly and asked for photos, which I provided. Then they asked if there was anything wrong with the product. Huh? I replied it has some issues (likely moisture related). Then they asked for details of issues. Huh? Well, I&#39;ve had enough of providing them details of the damaged/defective product.

INPUT: Had some problems getting it to work. The supplied cable was no good - would not charge the battery. When I replaced cable with my own was able to charge and then connect the device via bluetooth to a PC. Had trouble finding the PC software but when I emailed their support they responded within a day with the correct download info. PC program works well for testing the unit after you figure out which port to use (port 4 in my case).

Will have to hard-wire if I decide to use this device in my product.

The durability is my main issue I dropped the phone once onto a wood floor from about 12 inches and the screen cracked after having it for about 2 weeks. Otherwise it seemed to be a decent phone.

INPUT: I&#39;m never buying pads again! I&#39;ve been using these for months now and I absolutely love them. They&#39;re super durable and easy to clean, great for people with sensitive skin or who have allergies. These are soft, hypoallergenic, and super absorbent without feeling like wearing a diaper or something (at least, that&#39;s how I used to feel wearing pads). The money you spend now saves you ever having to spend on pads again.

INPUT: It‚Äôs a nice looking piece of furniture when assembled, but assembly was difficult. Some of the letter markings were incorrectly marked so I had to try and figure out on my own The screws they supplied to attach the floor and side panels all cracked.

The durability is my main issue I dropped the phone once onto a wood floor from about 12 inches and the screen cracked after having it for about 2 weeks. Otherwise it seemed to be a decent phone.

The bad news: my grill was 1/2&#34; too wide, so I had to saw off the nubs on the end of the grates to fit. The good news: they are definitely solid stainless as advertised, so I am not worried about these grates de-laminating like my old factory grates. Glad I bought these.

INPUT: My cousin has one for his kid, my daughter loves it. I got one for my back yard,but not easy to find a good spot to hang it. After i cut some trees, now its prefect. Having lots of fun with my daughter. Nice swing, easy to install.

INPUT: As a hard shell jacket, it‚Äôs pretty good. I ordered the extra large for a skiing trip. It comes small so order a size bigger then normal. I can not use the fleece liner because it is too small. The hard shell is not water proof. I live in the Pacific Northwest and this is not enough to keep you dry. I really like the look of this jacket too.

INPUT: These sunglasses are GREAT quality, and super stylish. I didn&#39;t think I&#39;d love any sunnies off of Amazon, but this was the first pair I took a chance on and I love them! Definitely a great buy!
OUTPUT: positive

INPUT: The child hat is ridiculously small. It was not even close to the right size for my 3 year old son. I checked the size, and it wouldn&#39;t have even fit him as a newborn. I liked the adult hat but it is not sold separately. The seller was rude and unhelpful when I contacted them directly through Amazon. The faux fur pom was either already torn or tore when I was trying on the hat. See the attached photograph. The pom came aprt, exposing the inner fluff.
OUTPUT: negative

INPUT: We bring the kid to Cape Cod this long weekend. The shelter is very helpful when we stay on the beach. Kid feel comfortable when she was in the shelter.

INPUT: Seriously the fluffiest towels! The color is beautiful, exactly as pictured, and they are bigger than I expected. Plus, I spent the same amount of money for these that I would have on the &#34;premium&#34; (non-organic) towels from Wal-Mart. You can&#39;t go wrong.

INPUT: The umbrella itself is great but buyer beware they send you a random umbrella and not the design you pick. It&#39;s a good thing my daughter likes all the Disney princesses or I would have had an upset 3 year old. I picked a design that showed 4 different princesses on it and received one that had only snow white and the 7 dwarfs on it. When I went to the site I read the fine print that they pick the umbrellas at random so no need to return.

INPUT: This is definitely the shampoo the Stars use. My hair is never smelt better or felt softer in my entire life. I felt like a model walking down the street with my hair bouncing and blowing in the wind. I highly recommend this product. I did not use it for a drug test, I just wanted to see if it would clean out the impurities from my hair which it seems to have done.
OUTPUT: positive

INPUT: The picture shows the fuel canister with the mosquito repeller attached so I assumed it would be included. However, when I opened the package I discovered there was no fuel.

INPUT: I hate to give this product one star when it probably deserves 5. My dog has chronic itchy skin and I had high hopes that this product would be the answer to his skin issues. I&#39;ll never know because he won&#39;t eat them. At first I gave them to him as a treat. He sniffed it and walked away. I crumbled just one up in his food but he was onto me and wouldn&#39;t touch it. So, sadly, the search continues.

INPUT: I did a lot of thinking as I read this book. I felt as though I could really picture what the main character was going through. The author did a great job describing the situations and events. I really rooted for the main character and felt her struggles. It seems as though she had to over come a lot to once again over come a lot. She had a group of interesting characters both supporting her and also ones who were against her. Not a plot to be predicted. I highly recommend this book. It grabbed my attention from the first page and had me thinking about it long after. I look forward to reading the author&#39;s next book.

OUTPUT: neutral

INPUT: 3 1/2 Stars Remedy is a brothers best friend romance as well as a second chance romance mixed into one. It&#39;s a unique story, and the hero (Grady) has to do everything to get Collins back and prove he&#39;s the guy for her. Three years ago, Grady and Collins had an amazing night together. Collins thought she was finally getting everything she dreamed of, her brothers best friend... but when she woke up alone the next morning, and never heard from her, things definitely changed. Now Grady is back, and he&#39;s not leaving, and he&#39;s doing everything in his power to prove to her why he left, and that he&#39;s not giving her up this time around. While I loved the premise of this story, and at times Grady, he really got on my nerves. I totally understand his reasoning for leaving that night, but to not even send a letter to Collins explaining himself? To leave her wondering and hurt for all those years, and then expect her to welcome him back with open arms? Was he delusional?! Collins was right to be upset, angry, hurt, etc. She was right to put up a fight with him when he wanted her back and to move forward. I admire her will power, because Grady was persistent. I loved Collins in this book, she was strong, and she guarded her heart, and I admired her for that. Sure she loved Grady, but she was scared, and hesitant to let him back in her life, who wouldn&#39;t be after what he did to her? Her character was definitely my favorite out of the two. She definitely let things go at the pace she wanted, and when she was ready to listen, she listened. There is a lot of angst in this book, and I did enjoy watching these two reconnect when Collins started to forgive Grady, I just wish Grady would have not come off as so whiney and would have been a little more understanding. He kept saying he understood, but at times he was a little too pushy to me, and then he was sweet towards the end. I ended up loving him just as much as Collins, but in the beginning of the book, I had a hard time reading his points of view because I couldn&#39;t connect with his character. The first part of this book, was not my favorite, but he second part? I adored, hence my rating. If you like second chance, and brothers best friend romances, you may really enjoy this book, I just had a hard time with Grady at first and how he handled some of the things he did.

Once you start to read this book, it‚Äôs hard to put down. Funny, witty and very entertaining!! Siri has gone above and beyond in her efforts to rescue cats (mainly Siamese)!!
OUTPUT: positive

INPUT: This book was okay I guess. I was not really fond of Jaime&#39;s views on things but oh well. Quinn was a wise cracker, but otherwise okay. Jaime should have set her parents down when she was younger and told them both they were messing up her life, maybe she wouldn&#39;t have been so messed up. Otherwise it was okay book.

INPUT: These little lights are awesome. They put off a nice amount of light. And you can put them ANYWHERE! I have put one in the pantry. Another in my linen closet. Another one right next to my bed for when I get up in the middle of the night. Have only had them about a month but so far so good!

OUTPUT: positive

INPUT: This is a great little portable table. Easy to build and tuck away in a corner. One big flaw is that the tabletop comes off easily. Adjusting the height becomes a 2 hand job or else the top may come off when pressing the lever.

INPUT: It will do the job of holding shoes. It&#39;s not glamorous, but it holds shoes and stands in a closet. You will need help with the shelving assembly as it is a two person job.

INPUT: Please do not buy this! I was so excited and I got one for me and my co worker because we freeze in our offices. It&#39;s so small and barely even heats up. One of them didn&#39;t even work at all!
OUTPUT: negative

INPUT: So pretty...but the first time I unplugged it, the glass top came off of the base. There‚Äôs a plastic ring attached to the bottom of the glass part. It has notches - supposedly to allow you to twist it onto the nightlight base. You‚Äôd need to be able to do that in order to replace the bulb. I‚Äôll try gorilla glue or something to see if the ring can be securely affixed to the glass. Surprisingly poor design for something so beautiful.
OUTPUT: negative

INPUT: Love the light. Fits with out furniture. Great overall but the floor switch isn&#39;t convenient to possible add a switch on the light itself. We ended up running the floor switch up between the couch sections so we can operate the light without having to find the switch on the floor

If you want something with the ability to open with your fingerprint, you&#39;ll need to spend a bit more, but if fingerprint id isn&#39;t something you absolutely need to have, then this safe is for you.

INPUT: Looking at orher reviews the tail was supposed to be obscenely long -- it was actually the perfect size but im not sure if thats intentional. The waist strap fits perfectly-- but again, need to list that my waist is fairly wide and it sat on my hips. Im unsure about the life of the strap. To the actual quality the fur seems of a fair (not great but not terrible quality but the tail isnt fully stuffed.) Apparently theres supposed to be a wire to pose the tail. There is none in mine, which is fine cause again, mine came up shorter than others. Im only rating 3 stars because of some unintentional good things.

INPUT: For a fitness tracker it is adequate. Heart rate monitor works ok. I feel it has missed steps in my everyday walking but if you start the monitor for fitness then it does well. If you hold anything in the arm with the tracker and cant move your arm it counts nothing. Battery life on the tracker is amazing. It lasts 7 to 8 days on a charge. It charges very fast. The wrist band is not very comfortable. Do to the way it charges i am not sure you can switch bands. I have not looked into this.

INPUT: The clear backing lacks the stickiness to keep the letters adhered until you‚Äôre finished weeding! It‚Äôs so frustrating to have to keep up with a bunch of letters and pieces that have curled and fell off the paper! It requires additional work to make sure that they‚Äôre aligned properly and being applied on the right side, which was an issue for me several times! I purchased 3 packs of this and while it‚Äôs okay for larger designs, it sucks for lettering or anything intricate üòè Possibly it‚Äôs old and dried out, but in any event, I will not be buying from this vendor again and suggest that you don‚Äôt either!

This alignment prevents one of the doors from staying closed as the magnet to keep the door closed is out of line. Still haven‚Äôt figured out to align them.

INPUT: These are very fragile. I have a cat who is a bit rambunctious and sometimes knocks my phone off my nightstand while it&#39;s plugged in. He managed to break all of these the first or second time he did that. I&#39;m sure they&#39;re fine if you&#39;re very careful with them, but if whatever you&#39;re charging falls off a table or nightstand while plugged in, these are very likely to stop working quickly.

I really like the look of this jacket too.
OUTPUT: neutral

INPUT: Quality made from a family business. Sometimes a challenge to move around due to the chew toys hanging off but gives our puppy something to knaw on throughout the night. 5 month update: Our dog doesn&#39;t destroy many toys but since he truly loves this one he has ripped off the head, the tail rope, torn a few corner rope rings, put teeth marks in the internal foam and now ripped the underside of the cover. I&#39;m giving this 4 stars still due to the simple fact that he LOVES this thing. Purchased right before they sold out, maybe the new model is more durable. Update with new model: The newer model has some areas where design has decreased in quality. The &#34;tail&#34; rope is not attached nearly as well as the first one. However, so far nothing has been ripped off of it in the 3 weeks since we have received it. He still loves it though!
OUTPUT: neutral

INPUT: I got this backpack Monday night and I was excited about it because I had seen many great reviews for it. I used it for the first time the next day to hold a fair amount of things, and while I was out I noticed this huge rip right down the middle that wasn&#39;t there before. I would have been more understanding if I had it for a few months but this was the first time I had put anything into it. I&#39;ve never been more disappointed in a product before as I have with this backpack. Be very careful when considering purchasing this product.

I purchased 3 packs of this and while it‚Äôs okay for larger designs, it sucks for lettering or anything intricate üòè Possibly it‚Äôs old and dried out, but in any event, I will not be buying from this vendor again and suggest that you don‚Äôt either!

I would probably use them in other situations as well if they were all the same. And yes I understand, if they are hand carved from one piece of wood, there could be slight difference, but that‚Äôs where product quality control comes in. I guess they just didn‚Äôt want any faulty products and decided to sell them all no matter what.

INPUT: Very cheap a dollar store item and u can not sweep all material into pan as the edge is not beveled correctly
OUTPUT: negative

INPUT: I love the glass design and the shape is comfortable in one hand. My first purchase of this kettle lasted for two years of daily use. The hinge on the lid is fragile, and since the lid doesn&#39;t flip entirely back - it gets strained and broke within the year. Everything else worked fine until the auto shut-off stopped working after two years. For safety, I bought a new one which has now stopped working entirely after 17 months. I still love the design, but for $58 I expected it to last longer.
OUTPUT: neutral

INPUT: I like these storage bins overall. The color of the lining inside wasn‚Äôt expected, it shows a light brown color in the photo but it‚Äôs pretty dark. I would have preferred the lining inside to match the outside, tan or grey. Other than that they are cute and look as pictured.

INPUT: It‚Äôs a nice looking piece of furniture when assembled, but assembly was difficult. Some of the letter markings were incorrectly marked so I had to try and figure out on my own The screws they supplied to attach the floor and side panels all cracked. I had to go out and purchase corner brackets to make sure they stayed together. Also the glass panel doors are out of line and don‚Äôt match evenly. This alignment prevents one of the doors from staying closed as the magnet to keep the door closed is out of line. Still haven‚Äôt figured out to align them.

INPUT: Didn&#39;t expect much for the price, and that&#39;s about what I got. It covers and protects my table, just have to live with a grid of folds from packaging. Seller advised to use a hair dryer to flatten out the wrinkles, but it was a very painstakingly slow process that only took some of the sharp edges off of the folds, didn&#39;t make much difference. Going to invest in something better (and much more expensive) for daily use, this is OK for what it does.

INPUT: This case is ok, but not exceptional - a 3.5 or 4 max. The issue is there are fewer cases available for the Tab A 10.1 w S pen. Of those the Gumdrop is about the best, but it has some serious issues. The case rubber (silicone, whatever) is very smooth and slick, and doesn&#39;t give you a lot of confidence when hold the Tab with one hand. The Tab A is heavy so if your laying down watching a video the case slips in your hand so you have to make frequent adjustments. I had to remove the clear plastic shield that covers the screen because it impaired the touch screen operation. This affected the strength of the 1-piece plastic frame the surrounds the Tab A, so now the rubber outer cover feels really flexible and flimsy. Lastly, they made it difficult to get to the S pen. The S pen is in the back bottom right hand corner of the Tab A, and they made the little rubber flap that protects corner swing backwards for access to the S pen. This means in order to get the S pen out, the flap has to swing out 180 degrees. This is really awkward and hard to do with one hand. This case does a good job protecting my Tab A, but with these serious design flaws I can&#39;t recommend it unless you have an S pen, then you don&#39;t have much choice.

INPUT: My dog loves this toy, I haven&#39;t seen hear more thrill with any other toy, for the first three days, which is how long the squeaker lasted. She is not a heavy chewer, and in one of her &#34;victory walks&#34; after retrieving the ball, the squeaker was already gone. Apart from that it is my best investment

OUTPUT: positive

INPUT: The toy is ok but it came in what they call &#34;standard packaging&#34; and that amounted to a plain brown cardboard box, NOT the colorful box in the photo. Can&#39;t give this as a gift in this cardboard packaging.
OUTPUT: neutral

INPUT: Quality made from a family business. Sometimes a challenge to move around due to the chew toys hanging off but gives our puppy something to knaw on throughout the night. 5 month update: Our dog doesn&#39;t destroy many toys but since he truly loves this one he has ripped off the head, the tail rope, torn a few corner rope rings, put teeth marks in the internal foam and now ripped the underside of the cover. I&#39;m giving this 4 stars still due to the simple fact that he LOVES this thing. Purchased right before they sold out, maybe the new model is more durable. Update with new model: The newer model has some areas where design has decreased in quality. The &#34;tail&#34; rope is not attached nearly as well as the first one. However, so far nothing has been ripped off of it in the 3 weeks since we have received it. He still loves it though!
OUTPUT: neutral

INPUT: I hate to give this product one star when it probably deserves 5. My dog has chronic itchy skin and I had high hopes that this product would be the answer to his skin issues. I&#39;ll never know because he won&#39;t eat them. At first I gave them to him as a treat. He sniffed it and walked away. I crumbled just one up in his food but he was onto me and wouldn&#39;t touch it. So, sadly, the search continues.

The piano isn‚Äôt only a play toy, but it actually works and allows your child to play music at an early age. If you want your child to be a future pianist, you should try this product out! Very worth the money!
OUTPUT: positive

INPUT: I was very disappointed in this item. It is very soft and not chewy. It falls apart in your hand. My dog eats them but I prefer a more chewy treat for my dog.

OUTPUT: negative

INPUT: This case is ok, but not exceptional - a 3.5 or 4 max. The issue is there are fewer cases available for the Tab A 10.1 w S pen. Of those the Gumdrop is about the best, but it has some serious issues. The case rubber (silicone, whatever) is very smooth and slick, and doesn&#39;t give you a lot of confidence when hold the Tab with one hand. The Tab A is heavy so if your laying down watching a video the case slips in your hand so you have to make frequent adjustments. I had to remove the clear plastic shield that covers the screen because it impaired the touch screen operation. This affected the strength of the 1-piece plastic frame the surrounds the Tab A, so now the rubber outer cover feels really flexible and flimsy. Lastly, they made it difficult to get to the S pen. The S pen is in the back bottom right hand corner of the Tab A, and they made the little rubber flap that protects corner swing backwards for access to the S pen. This means in order to get the S pen out, the flap has to swing out 180 degrees. This is really awkward and hard to do with one hand. This case does a good job protecting my Tab A, but with these serious design flaws I can&#39;t recommend it unless you have an S pen, then you don&#39;t have much choice.

Instead, I was given 97 Unstable cards per box, and 4 random MTG commons. I paid for 100 Unstable cards! Not 97 and 4 random cards! Also, the boxes they advertise are not too great. They do the job of holding the cards, but that&#39;s about it. I&#39;m definitely getting a new case for these. If you want to buy, don&#39;t take it too seriously. Don&#39;t expect all 100 cards to be Unstable, and expect multiples.

INPUT: I would love to give this product 5 star but unfortunately it just doesn‚Äôt cut due to quality. I bought them only (and only) for my toddlers snacks. And for that purpose they work great. I would probably use them in other situations as well if they were all the same.

Every time I try, I get the error message. Even when I am 10&#39; away from the Wifi unit. I followed the YouTube setup video with no success. When I purchased the unit, I thought it would connect directly to my wife&#39;s phone (like Bluetooth). Instead, this scale uses the Wifi router to communicate to the phone. This system is limited to the router connection...which is usually not close to the bedroom unlike a cell phone! I wouldn&#39;t recommend this scale to anyone because of the Wifi connection. Instead, please look at systems that use Bluetooth for communication. I am replacing this with a Bluetooth connection scale.

OUTPUT: negative

INPUT: This product exceeded my expectations. I am not good about cleaning my make up brushes. In fact when I received this cleaner it had been months since I last cleaned them. So I figured at best they should be a little better off. It was better than that! My brushes are like new! A couple I needed to clean two times, but considering how much build up on them there was, was completely warranted. I‚Äôm so excited that I discovered this product as I finally have a reason to buy nicer brushes! Clean up was easy!
OUTPUT: positive

INPUT: The graphics were not centered and placed more towards the handle than what the Amazon image shows. Only the person drinking can see the graphics. I will be returning the item.
OUTPUT: negative

INPUT: I love how it&#39;s made of a strechy material and a light shirt. So cute.
OUTPUT: positive

INPUT: Smudges easily and collects in corners of eyes throughout the day. Goes on smooth and rich without clumping.
OUTPUT: neutral

INPUT: This is literally just a cardstock. Not a canvas and needs to be framed to display. Not a good price considering all it is.
OUTPUT: neutral

INPUT: Absolutely terrible. I ordered these expecting a quality product for 10 dollars. They were shipped in an envelope inside of another envelope all just banging against each other while on their way to me from the seller. 3 of them are broken internally, they make a rattle noise as the ones that work do not. I will be requesting a refund for these and filing a complaint with Amazon. Don&#39;t purchase unless you like to buy broken/damaged goods. Completely worthless.

INPUT: My dog loves this toy, I haven&#39;t seen hear more thrill with any other toy, for the first three days, which is how long the squeaker lasted. She is not a heavy chewer, and in one of her &#34;victory walks&#34; after retrieving the ball, the squeaker was already gone. Apart from that it is my best investment
OUTPUT: neutral

INPUT: I have three of these linked together. As many of the other reviews said, the legs are weak and prone to breakage even with careful use. It is best to provide some other means of support and not use the legs. Also the gaskets at the fittings do not seal well. I used RTV silicone sealant when assembling the water fittings to stop the leakage. These units are doing a good job heating my pool.
OUTPUT: neutral

INPUT: These are great for SO many things. Originally I had them in my drink at a club but then later bought them for my wedding center pieces. The light stays on for weeks but becomes dim after 3 or 4 days. We had a great time leaving the extra ones around the party and will use the extra ones for fun.
OUTPUT: positive

INPUT: Looking at orher reviews the tail was supposed to be obscenely long -- it was actually the perfect size but im not sure if thats intentional. The waist strap fits perfectly-- but again, need to list that my waist is fairly wide and it sat on my hips. Im unsure about the life of the strap. To the actual quality the fur seems of a fair (not great but not terrible quality but the tail isnt fully stuffed.) Apparently theres supposed to be a wire to pose the tail. There is none in mine, which is fine cause again, mine came up shorter than others. Im only rating 3 stars because of some unintentional good things.
OUTPUT: neutral

INPUT: Not super durable. The bag holds up okay but the drawstrings sometimes tear if the bag gets past a couple lbs.
OUTPUT: neutral

INPUT: I hate to give this product one star when it probably deserves 5. My dog has chronic itchy skin and I had high hopes that this product would be the answer to his skin issues. I&#39;ll never know because he won&#39;t eat them. At first I gave them to him as a treat. He sniffed it and walked away. I crumbled just one up in his food but he was onto me and wouldn&#39;t touch it. So, sadly, the search continues.
OUTPUT: negative

INPUT: My cats went CRAZY over this!
OUTPUT: positive

INPUT: Smell doesn&#39;t last as long as I would like. When first opened, it smells great!
OUTPUT: neutral

INPUT: Quality made from a family business. Sometimes a challenge to move around due to the chew toys hanging off but gives our puppy something to knaw on throughout the night. 5 month update: Our dog doesn&#39;t destroy many toys but since he truly loves this one he has ripped off the head, the tail rope, torn a few corner rope rings, put teeth marks in the internal foam and now ripped the underside of the cover. I&#39;m giving this 4 stars still due to the simple fact that he LOVES this thing. Purchased right before they sold out, maybe the new model is more durable. Update with new model: The newer model has some areas where design has decreased in quality. The &#34;tail&#34; rope is not attached nearly as well as the first one. However, so far nothing has been ripped off of it in the 3 weeks since we have received it. He still loves it though!
OUTPUT: neutral

INPUT: The 8 year old nephew said he wanted this for his birthday. I felt it was a bit much for a toy but he caught me on a good day. Come to find out it&#39;s a fragile collectible so the nephew lost all the small parts the moment he opened it. I guess it&#39;s adequate for collectors that want detail on such a small figurine.
OUTPUT: neutral

INPUT: I can not tell you how many times I have bought one of these. My dogs are obsessed with them! The legs don‚Äôt last long but the rest of it does, probably one of the longer lasting toys they have had.

INPUT: Im not sure if its just this sellers stock of this product or what but the first order was no good, each bottle had mold and clumps in the bottle and usually companies will put a couple of metal beads in a bottle to aid in the mixing but these had a rock in it... like a rock off the ground.

OUTPUT: negative

INPUT: My dog ,a super hyper Yorkie, wouldn&#39;t eat these. Didn&#39;t like the smell of them and probably didn&#39;t like the taste. I did manage to get them down him for 3 days to see if it would help him . The process of getting them down him was traumatic for him and me. They did not seem to have any effect on him one way or another , other than the fact that he didn&#39;t like them and didn&#39;t want to eat them. I ended up throwing them away. Money down the drain. Sorry, I can&#39;t recommend them.

The colorful tags make it easier to find what I want. The material is strong. I finally get something to help with the messy drawer! Love this product!

OUTPUT: positive

INPUT: The clear backing lacks the stickiness to keep the letters adhered until you‚Äôre finished weeding! It‚Äôs so frustrating to have to keep up with a bunch of letters and pieces that have curled and fell off the paper! It requires additional work to make sure that they‚Äôre aligned properly and being applied on the right side, which was an issue for me several times! I purchased 3 packs of this and while it‚Äôs okay for larger designs, it sucks for lettering or anything intricate üòè Possibly it‚Äôs old and dried out, but in any event, I will not be buying from this vendor again and suggest that you don‚Äôt either!

INPUT: I would love to give this product 5 star but unfortunately it just doesn‚Äôt cut due to quality. I bought them only (and only) for my toddlers snacks. And for that purpose they work great. I would probably use them in other situations as well if they were all the same. And yes I understand, if they are hand carved from one piece of wood, there could be slight difference, but that‚Äôs where product quality control comes in. I guess they just didn‚Äôt want any faulty products and decided to sell them all no matter what.

INPUT: I love how the waist doesn&#39;t have an elastic band in them. I have a bad back and tight waist bands always make my back feel worse.These feel decent...although If they could make them just one size larger..and not just offer plus size....that would be even better for my back.

Texto de entrada: No s√© qui√©n puede estar interesado en semejante producto. Casi ninguna de las funciones funcionan. Lo que funciona es la calculadora,el reproductor de m√∫sica, lo de contar los pasos y poco m√°s. No sirve para nada poder mandar SMS, que cuestan dinero y nadie utiliza casi para nada, si no puedes utilizar el whatsapp, que es lo que todos tenemos y necesitamos. Ni whatsapp ni facebook, ni nada se puede usar. El reloj necesitar√≠a otra tarjeta SIM para hacer llamadas sin conectarse al tel√©fono por bluetooth pero eso significa que te cobrar√°n unos cuatro euros m√°s en tu operador de telefonia cada mes. El bluetooth es mal√≠simo y no llega ni a unos cent√≠metros, con lo cual no me llegaba ni de la mu√±eca hasta los cascos de las orejas. Para correr y escuchar m√∫sica y mirar la hora...te durar√° media hora y eso con suerte y si tienes la suerte de que te llegue la se√±al a tus cascos desde el brazo.

Puedes tener las manos llenas de jab√≥n o agua y solo con aproximar la mano al sensor el dispensador se activa. Es muy f√°cil de utilizar, dispone de dos botones, + y - estos sirven para graduar la descarga del dispensador. Pulsando m√°s de 3 segundos el +, podemos encenderlo o apagarlo. La carga se efect√∫a por la parte superior desde un tap√≥n de media rosca. Destacar que el dispensador utiliza 4 pilas del tipo A++ que no van incluidas en el paquete.

Texto de entrada: No s√© qui√©n puede estar interesado en semejante producto. Casi ninguna de las funciones funcionan. Lo que funciona es la calculadora,el reproductor de m√∫sica, lo de contar los pasos y poco m√°s. No sirve para nada poder mandar SMS, que cuestan dinero y nadie utiliza casi para nada, si no puedes utilizar el whatsapp, que es lo que todos tenemos y necesitamos. Ni whatsapp ni facebook, ni nada se puede usar. El reloj necesitar√≠a otra tarjeta SIM para hacer llamadas sin conectarse al tel√©fono por bluetooth pero eso significa que te cobrar√°n unos cuatro euros m√°s en tu operador de telefonia cada mes. El bluetooth es mal√≠simo y no llega ni a unos cent√≠metros, con lo cual no me llegaba ni de la mu√±eca hasta los cascos de las orejas. Para correr y escuchar m√∫sica y mirar la hora...te durar√° media hora y eso con suerte y si tienes la suerte de que te llegue la se√±al a tus cascos desde el brazo.

Puedes tener las manos llenas de jab√≥n o agua y solo con aproximar la mano al sensor el dispensador se activa. Es muy f√°cil de utilizar, dispone de dos botones, + y - estos sirven para graduar la descarga del dispensador. Pulsando m√°s de 3 segundos el +, podemos encenderlo o apagarlo. La carga se efect√∫a por la parte superior desde un tap√≥n de media rosca. Destacar que el dispensador utiliza 4 pilas del tipo A++ que no van incluidas en el paquete.

Input text: No s√© qui√©n puede estar interesado en semejante producto. Casi ninguna de las funciones funcionan. Lo que funciona es la calculadora,el reproductor de m√∫sica, lo de contar los pasos y poco m√°s. No sirve para nada poder mandar SMS, que cuestan dinero y nadie utiliza casi para nada, si no puedes utilizar el whatsapp, que es lo que todos tenemos y necesitamos. Ni whatsapp ni facebook, ni nada se puede usar. El reloj necesitar√≠a otra tarjeta SIM para hacer llamadas sin conectarse al tel√©fono por bluetooth pero eso significa que te cobrar√°n unos cuatro euros m√°s en tu operador de telefonia cada mes. El bluetooth es mal√≠simo y no llega ni a unos cent√≠metros, con lo cual no me llegaba ni de la mu√±eca hasta los cascos de las orejas. Para correr y escuchar m√∫sica y mirar la hora...te durar√° media hora y eso con suerte y si tienes la suerte de que te llegue la se√±al a tus cascos desde el brazo. Muy muy muy decepcionada con este producto. Devuelto al d√≠a siguiente. Una tomadura de pelo.

Como fallo dir√© que no me gusta que las pilar recargables no sean de un tama√±o estandar. Es decir, son mucho mas grandes que las pilas normales y si alg√∫n dia se estropean desconozco si se podr√°n encontrar facilmente. Espero que duren muchos a√±os.

Input text: Despu√©s de unos meses de uso cambio mi valoraci√≥n seguido de mi opini√≥n: El dispensador ha dejado de funcionar correctamente, el vendedor s√≥lo me contest√≥ para preguntarme por el n√∫mero de pedido, una vez se lo dije... no he vuelto a saber nada mas de el, ni ha dado soluciones, ni mucho menos ha intentado buscarlas o averiguar por que falla. Por otro lado destacar que ha empezado a oxidarse... Raro ya que el anuncio pon√≠a claramente de Acero Inoxidable... ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ La tecnolog√≠a llega a nuestras casas... hace unos meses compr√© una papelera/basura tambi√©n con sensor de proximidad y apertura autom√°tica. Quede muy contento y me arriesgue con este dispensador de jab√≥n. La principal caracter√≠stica y ventaja es que no &#34;pringas&#34; nada. Puedes tener las manos llenas de jab√≥n o agua y solo con aproximar la mano al sensor el dispensador se activa. Es muy f√°cil de utilizar, dispone de dos botones, + y - estos sirven para graduar la descarga del dispensador. Pulsando m√°s de 3 segundos el +, podemos encenderlo o apagarlo. La carga se efect√∫a por la parte superior desde un tap√≥n de media rosca. Destacar que el dispensador utiliza 4 pilas del tipo A++ que no van incluidas en el paquete.

EJEMPLO: Era un regalo y la verdad que esta dando la talla que deseaba!! Facil de utilizaci√≥n y muy creativo.
RESPUESTA: positivo

EJEMPLO: A los 3-4 dias dd haber llegado el telefono, la camara trasera dejo de funcionar. Me puse en contacto con ellos para tramitar un cambio, pero me pedian que devolviera este primero y luego ellos me mandaban otro, por lo que me quedaba sin movil, creo que lo mas conveniente es igual que viene el mensajero a traerme uno nuevo, a ma vez que se lleve el estropeado... no me podia quedar sin movil ya que solo tengo este y lo necesito. A dia de hoy todav√≠a ando con el movil sin camara trasera... un desastre. NO LO RECOMIENDO PARA NADA!
RESPUESTA: negativo

EJEMPLO: Est√° bien para el precio que tiene, no sirve para llevar cosas fr√≠as, el tama√±o es un poco justo, caben dos tuppers peque√±os y una lata
RESPUESTA: neutro

EJEMPLO: Tuve uno de la marca Kong y lo rompi√≥ en dos d√≠as, este es mas ‚Äúduro‚Äù y resistente y vuela un poco m√°s. Encantado con la compra

EJEMPLO: Aparentemente tiene muy buena calidad y un gran precio para venir tres protectores. Ning√∫n problema a nivel t√°ctil muy transparente, del tama√±o exacto para la pantalla. Sin embargo, el primero no fui capaz de que se adhiriera a la pantalla (quedaba despegado la mitad); pens√© que era mi inexperiencia. El segundo qued√≥ ya mejor, pero a√∫n y todo, no adherido del todo. Y ah√≠ ya no es por exceso de confianza. Gracias a que uso una funda tipo libro la pantalla no queda expuesta y he reservado el tercer protector para m√°s adelante.
RESPUESTA: neutro

EJEMPLO: El cristal le va peque√±o a la pantalla, por los lados sobra un monton as√≠ que no lo cubre por completo, uno de los 2 cristales que iban en el paquete llevaba como una mota de polvo de fabrica insalvable. No lo recomiendo.
RESPUESTA: negativo

EJEMPLO: La facil instalacion y la calidad del mismo
RESPUESTA: positivo

EJEMPLO: Un desastre de producto. Los globos imposibles de inchar, sin instrucciones, Valvulas imposibles y que se rompen. No lo recomiendo en absoluto.
RESPUESTA: negativo

EJEMPLO: Cumple su prop√≥sito aunque son bastante endebles, hay que poner prendas ligeras si no se abren por el peso.
RESPUESTA: neutro

EJEMPLO: Son dos pantallas protectoras bastante f√°ciles de instalar. Vienen en una cajita muy elegante con un mont√≥n de complementos e instrucciones sencillas para que puedas instalarlas con suma facilidad. No se ensucian mucho y aguantan bastante.
RESPUESTA:

EJEMPLO: Todav√≠a no he tenido tiempo de probarlo, a tener en cuenta que no lleva pilas, hay que comprarlas , son de las peque√±as no de las de boton sino de las otras.
RESPUESTA: neutro

EJEMPLO: Es un disfraz que solo entra la parte de arriba del traje, viene con una m√°scara d l√°tex gruesa que viene toda doblada y deforme. Pero eso no es lo peor, lo peor es que el traje cuesta 45‚Ç¨ y deber√≠an de darte 45‚Ç¨ por pon√©rtelo, por que es un espanto para el precio que tiene, una tela p√©sima, como un traje de carnaval del bazar oriental de 6‚Ç¨.

RESPUESTA: neutro

EJEMPLO: Magn√≠fico cable recibe la se√±al perfectamente.
RESPUESTA: positivo

EJEMPLO: Me he quedado un tanto decepcionado con el producto. Baja estabilidad, materiales poco resistentes, sensaci√≥n de poco recorrido hacen que lo pagado sea lo justo por lo recibido.

En tu respuesta incluye s√≥lo el nombre de la clase, como una √∫nica palabra, en min√∫scula, sin puntuaci√≥n, y sin a√±adir ninguna otra afirmaci√≥n o palabra.

EJEMPLO: Lo compr√© para un regalo y ser√° utilizado con un iPhone X. No he tenido la oportunidad de probarlo con dicho tel√©fono, pero puedo hablar de la excelente calidad de los materiales, es pesado, se siente firme y tiene franjas con goma tanto en la parte superior para que el tel√©fono no se deslice y en su parte inferior para que no se deslice sobre la superficie donde se ubica. S√≥lo lo he conectado para probar las luces (azules) y si colocas un dispositivo para cargar, est√°s parpadean muy lentamente unas 5 veces y luego se apagan definitivamente, cosa que es de agradecer si lo vas a usar en tu mesa de noche. Por ahora lo recomiendo est√©ticamente, luego informar√© de su funcionamiento.
RESPUESTA: positivo

EJEMPLO: Estaria bien que fuese mas largo el hueco pars que no se quede tsn colgado el pints labios. Cumple su funcion si no tienes mucho dinero.
RESPUESTA: neutro

EJEMPLO: Buenos materiales. Gran sonido. Sin problemas de conexi√≥n con ning√∫n dispositivo Bluetooth que he probado. Los leds le dan un toque chic.
RESPUESTA: neutro

EJEMPLO: Pues me dej√© guiar por las buenas opiniones y al final ha sido un triunfazo!! a todos en casa les ha encantado. F√°cil de instalar. Todo en √©l es met√°lico lo que le da robustez. He probado un poco el sonido y bueno no hay color de grabar con este micr√≥fono a uno de auriculares que usaba antes, lo que si aconsejo que no lo pongais muy cerca de la torre del ordenador y m√°s si es antigua porque por muy bueno que sea el micro milagros no hace jeje Viene con un usb que por ejemplo yo lo usar√© para ponerlo en el portatil y poder conectarle el microfono y unos auriculares y as√≠ poder editar con √©l.
RESPUESTA: positivo

EJEMPLO: la tela no es la que esperaba
RESPUESTA: neutro

EJEMPLO: No s√© qui√©n puede estar interesado en semejante producto. Casi ninguna de las funciones funcionan. Lo que funciona es la calculadora,el reproductor de m√∫sica, lo de contar los pasos y poco m√°s. No sirve para nada poder mandar SMS, que cuestan dinero y nadie utiliza casi para nada, si no puedes utilizar el whatsapp, que es lo que todos tenemos y necesitamos. Ni whatsapp ni facebook, ni nada se puede usar. El reloj necesitar√≠a otra tarjeta SIM para hacer llamadas sin conectarse al tel√©fono por bluetooth pero eso significa que te cobrar√°n unos cuatro euros m√°s en tu operador de telefonia cada mes. El bluetooth es mal√≠simo y no llega ni a unos cent√≠metros, con lo cual no me llegaba ni de la mu√±eca hasta los cascos de las orejas. Para correr y escuchar m√∫sica y mirar la hora...te durar√° media hora y eso con suerte y si tienes la suerte de que te llegue la se√±al a tus cascos desde el brazo. Muy muy muy decepcionada con este producto. Devuelto al d√≠a siguiente. Una tomadura de pelo.

RESPUESTA: negativo

EJEMPLO: Le hab√≠a dado cinco estrellas y una opini√≥n muy positiva, el aparato funcion√≥ bien mientras funcion√≥, el problema es que funcion√≥ poco tiempo. Hoy, apenas tres meses despu√©s de adquirirlo, he ido a encenderlo y en lugar de arrancar se ha quedado parado. Unos segundos m√°s tarde ha soltado un chispazo y ah√≠ se ha quedado. No se le ha dado ning√∫n golpe, ni se ha usado para nada distinto a su finalidad, as√≠ que la √∫nica explicaci√≥n l√≥gica es que viniera defectuoso de f√°brica.

RESPUESTA: negativo

EJEMPLO: Es bonito y el acabado de las tablas est√° bien (mejor que muchos de IKEA). No ocurre lo mismo con el de las varillas, que se raya con mirarlo y ya ven√≠a algo tocado del roce en la caja. El problema es que la varilla donde cuelgan las perchas, si son de metal, con seguridad lo va a desconchar. El montaje normal, al estilo IKEA, con instrucciones claras y herramientas necesarias. Con el uso iremos viendo el agua te de la rosca de los tornillos.

EJEMPLO: Muy buen producto. Viene con pilas para la luz. Muy estable y practico. La verdad es que lo recomiendo totalmente
RESPUESTA: positivo

EJEMPLO: Lo compr√© para un regalo y ser√° utilizado con un iPhone X. No he tenido la oportunidad de probarlo con dicho tel√©fono, pero puedo hablar de la excelente calidad de los materiales, es pesado, se siente firme y tiene franjas con goma tanto en la parte superior para que el tel√©fono no se deslice y en su parte inferior para que no se deslice sobre la superficie donde se ubica. S√≥lo lo he conectado para probar las luces (azules) y si colocas un dispositivo para cargar, est√°s parpadean muy lentamente unas 5 veces y luego se apagan definitivamente, cosa que es de agradecer si lo vas a usar en tu mesa de noche. Por ahora lo recomiendo est√©ticamente, luego informar√© de su funcionamiento.

RESPUESTA: neutro

EJEMPLO: Vienen un mont√≥n de cosas, como el cortahilos que me encanta , para empezar a bordar est√° muy bien. Los hilos no parecen de mala calidad, y hay muchos colores
RESPUESTA: positivo

Para esto esta genial, te libera las manos y puedes trabajar. Realmente vale para mucho mas, ya que tiene 2 intensidades de luz, intermitencias y luz roja atras. Como fallo dir√© que no me gusta que las pilar recargables no sean de un tama√±o estandar. Es decir, son mucho mas grandes que las pilas normales y si alg√∫n dia se estropean desconozco si se podr√°n encontrar facilmente. Espero que duren muchos a√±os. Como se ve en la foto, el producto biene muy completo.

EJEMPLO: Me ha gustado mucho el producto. El dise√±o y calidad muy buenos. El pedido lleg√≥ muy rapido. Me ha encantado
RESPUESTA: positivo

EJEMPLO: Para empezar, si el tiempo de env√≠o es largo, el producto se retrasa por problema de aduanas. Solicit√≥ la devoluci√≥n, ya que es para un regalo y ante la tardanza han adquirido una prenda similar en otro sitio. Amazon me pone en contacto con el vendedor, el cual no facilita la devoluci√≥n. Mientras tanto recibo el paquete y cu√°l es mi sorpresa que el art√≠culo q me env√≠an es un bolso negro, una especie de portafolios pero que nada tiene que ver con el sujetador de lactancia que encargue. Sigo en contacto con el vendedor, que a√∫n sigue sin darme ninguna soluci√≥n.
RESPUESTA: negativo

EJEMPLO: A pesar de estar tom√°ndome este producto durante dos meses y medio religiosamente cada d√≠a ,no sirve absolutamente de nada, porque sigo blanca como la pared. Admiro a las personas que lo han tomado y les ha funcionado pero desde luego a m√≠, no ha sido el caso. Dec√≠an que empezaba a funcionar desde el segundo mes pero pienso que aunque lo tomase 12 meses seguir√≠a igual.
RESPUESTA: negativo

EJEMPLO: El producto en si, esta bien, encaja perfecto, pero la mochila lleg√≥ con dos manchas de tinta supongo, y una de las cremalleras rota, aunque con la otra cierra bien.

En tu respuesta incluye s√≥lo el nombre de la clase, como una √∫nica palabra, en min√∫scula, sin puntuaci√≥n, y sin a√±adir ninguna otra afirmaci√≥n o palabra.

EJEMPLO: El producto y su propia caja en el que viene empaquetado los botes es bueno, pero la caja del env√≠o del trasporte es horrible. La caja del transporte llego completamente rota. De tal manera que los botes me los entregaron por un lado y la caja por otro. El transporte era de SEUR, muy mal.
RESPUESTA: neutro

EJEMPLO: Es justo lo que buscaba ni m√°s ni menos y adem√°s es como la que ten√≠a de hace ya a√±os.
RESPUESTA: positivo

EJEMPLO: Despues de 2 dias esperando la entrega ,tuve que ir a buscarlo a la central de DHL de tarragona ,pese a haber pagado gastos de envio (10 euros),y encima me encuentro con un paquete todo golpeado en el que faltan partes del embalaje de carton y el resto esta sujeto por multitud de tiras de celo gigantesco pata que no se desmonte el resto de la caja ,nefasto he hecho varias reclamaciones a la empresa de transporte y encima me encuentro el paquete en unas condiciones horrorosas con multiples golpes,espero que al menos funcione.Nada recomendable,ni el vendedor ni amazon ni por supuesto el transportista DHL.
RESPUESTA: negativo

EJEMPLO: A pesar de estar tom√°ndome este producto durante dos meses y medio religiosamente cada d√≠a ,no sirve absolutamente de nada, porque sigo blanca como la pared. Admiro a las personas que lo han tomado y les ha funcionado pero desde luego a m√≠, no ha sido el caso. Dec√≠an que empezaba a funcionar desde el segundo mes pero pienso que aunque lo tomase 12 meses seguir√≠a igual.
RESPUESTA: negativo

EJEMPLO: Por lo que cuesta, no est√° mal, recomendable su compra, como producto asequible.
RESPUESTA: neutro

EJEMPLO: El producto exacto y sin una queja. En cambio el transporte TARDE MAL Y NUNCA.

EJEMPLO: las he utilizado una vez, las he lavado en el lavavajillas y han salido oxidadas y eso que en la descripci√≥n pone que son de acero inoxidable... no las recomiendo
RESPUESTA: negativo

EJEMPLO: El envio correcto, el empaquetado correcto pero para su precio esperaba algo mas grande con eso no me llega ni para una pierna lo siento muy peque√±o

EJEMPLO: No corresponde con la descripci√≥n Se descarga r√°pido la bater√≠a He hecho reembolso del producto as de un mes y no me han devuelto el dinero
RESPUESTA: negativo

EJEMPLO: Las tallas ...es dificil acertar con la correcta o te aprietan mucho o te sobra...
RESPUESTA: neutro

EJEMPLO: Despu√©s de unos meses de uso cambio mi valoraci√≥n seguido de mi opini√≥n: El dispensador ha dejado de funcionar correctamente, el vendedor s√≥lo me contest√≥ para preguntarme por el n√∫mero de pedido, una vez se lo dije... no he vuelto a saber nada mas de el, ni ha dado soluciones, ni mucho menos ha intentado buscarlas o averiguar por que falla. Por otro lado destacar que ha empezado a oxidarse... Raro ya que el anuncio pon√≠a claramente de Acero Inoxidable... ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ La tecnolog√≠a llega a nuestras casas... hace unos meses compr√© una papelera/basura tambi√©n con sensor de proximidad y apertura autom√°tica. Quede muy contento y me arriesgue con este dispensador de jab√≥n. La principal caracter√≠stica y ventaja es que no &#34;pringas&#34; nada. Puedes tener las manos llenas de jab√≥n o agua y solo con aproximar la mano al sensor el dispensador se activa. Es muy f√°cil de utilizar, dispone de dos botones, + y - estos sirven para graduar la descarga del dispensador. Pulsando m√°s de 3 segundos el +, podemos encenderlo o apagarlo. La carga se efect√∫a por la parte superior desde un tap√≥n de media rosca. Destacar que el dispensador utiliza 4 pilas del tipo A++ que no van incluidas en el paquete.

En tu respuesta incluye s√≥lo el nombre de la clase, como una √∫nica palabra, en min√∫scula, sin puntuaci√≥n, y sin a√±adir ninguna otra afirmaci√≥n o palabra.

EJEMPLO: La funda para el sof√° es muy fina. El material no transmite sensaci√≥n de que vaya a durar en el tiempo, pero por el precio que tiene no podr√≠a pedirse algo mejor, o si?. Compr√© una funda de marca para la barbacoa y comprado con esta es de risa. En principio hace de repelente de agua, pero no lo he probado con lluvia torrencial, lo he probado tir√°ndole un poco de agua en una zona con un vaso. Habr√≠a que volver a valorar esta funda con el paso del tiempo para ver si merece la pena o no su compra.
RESPUESTA: neutro

EJEMPLO: El armario est√° bastante bien. Pero el tema de mensajeria deja mucho que desear, aunque llego relativamente rapido (algo menos de 2 semanas), vino con varios golpes los cuales dificultan el montaje e interrumpen el cierre y apertura de puertas
RESPUESTA: neutro

EJEMPLO: Estaba buscando unos cuchillos de carne que me durasen para much√≠simo tiempo sin importarme gastar un poco m√°s. A veces es mejor no comprar barato. Estos cuchillos van a sustituir a unos antiguos que ten√≠a que aunque hac√≠an bien su funci√≥n se me fueron estropeando porque el mango era de pl√°stico y de tanto lavado se fue estropeando esta parte. A primera vista ya se aprecia que son de muy buena calidad por los materiales con los que est√°n fabricados. A destacar tambi√©n el envoltorio ya que son perfectos para regalar. Muy buena compra.
RESPUESTA: positivo

EJEMPLO: Su estabilidad es muy buena, al igual que su uso. Pesa poco y ofrece mucha seguridad. Ideal para llegar a cualquier sitio normal.
RESPUESTA: positivo

EJEMPLO: Le hab√≠a dado cinco estrellas y una opini√≥n muy positiva, el aparato funcion√≥ bien mientras funcion√≥, el problema es que funcion√≥ poco tiempo. Hoy, apenas tres meses despu√©s de adquirirlo, he ido a encenderlo y en lugar de arrancar se ha quedado parado. Unos segundos m√°s tarde ha soltado un chispazo y ah√≠ se ha quedado. No se le ha dado ning√∫n golpe, ni se ha usado para nada distinto a su finalidad, as√≠ que la √∫nica explicaci√≥n l√≥gica es que viniera defectuoso de f√°brica. Amazon me va a reembolsar el importe en garant√≠a en cuanto lo devuelva, as√≠ que por ese lado no tengo queja.
RESPUESTA: negativo

EJEMPLO: Leyendo las opiniones de otros compradores no sabia que esperar. Las habia buenas y malas. Yo me quede a medias. Pense que se quedaria mas cerrado, y aunque aun no lo he probado con frutos secos (almendras...) que era principalmente para lo que lo queria, el sistema de cierre que tiene no me da ninguna seguridad. Para cosas de mayor tama√±o si lo veo adecuado para transportarlas (manzana, platano...) Si en lugar de un unico velcro, la tapa tuviese dos velcros si lo veria seguro (posiblemente me haga yo un apa√±o casero)

EJEMPLO: Aparentemente tiene muy buena calidad y un gran precio para venir tres protectores. Ning√∫n problema a nivel t√°ctil muy transparente, del tama√±o exacto para la pantalla. Sin embargo, el primero no fui capaz de que se adhiriera a la pantalla (quedaba despegado la mitad); pens√© que era mi inexperiencia. El segundo qued√≥ ya mejor, pero a√∫n y todo, no adherido del todo. Y ah√≠ ya no es por exceso de confianza. Gracias a que uso una funda tipo libro la pantalla no queda expuesta y he reservado el tercer protector para m√°s adelante.

EJEMPLO: Buen precio para la gran capacidad que tiene. No tiene ruido y es totalmente manejable.
RESPUESTA: positivo

EJEMPLO: Cuando una marca de prestigio pone un producto al mercado uno espera un m√≠nimo de calidad, Samsung Galaxy Fit e , no lo √©s. Tiene varios problemas, pero el m√°s significativo es que a la hora de deslizar las pantallas con el dedo te das cuenta que no funciona o que lo hace aveces, creo que Samsung no ha estado a la altura de lo que de ellos se espera. El √∫nico consuelo que nos queda es que estos fallos puedan ser corregidos por una actualizaci√≥n, y as√≠ disfrutar y no desesperarse de esta pulsera que por dise√±o merecer√≠a un mejor trato de su fabricante.
RESPUESTA: negativo

EJEMPLO: Los auriculares tienen un dise√±o atractivo, se emparejan facilmente y funcionan bien. Pero el audio es muy mejorable, tiene un sonido enlatado completamente, tambi√©n puede ser porque estoy acostumbrado a los del iphone que sinceramente se escuchan muy muy bien. Pero en cuanto al audio de unos auriculares soy bastante exigente.

EJEMPLO: Lo he probado en un Mac con sistema operativo High Sierra y al instalar los drivers me ha bloqueado el ordenador. He mirado en la p√°gina del fabricante y no tienen soporte actualizado para la √∫ltima versi√≥n del SO de Mac.
RESPUESTA: negativo

EJEMPLO: es f√°cil de poner e instalar pero , en cuanto le pides un poco m√°s de lo normal, no responde. El tener solo una boca hace que tengas que poner un switch y, si de ese sale un cable que va a otra habitaci√≥n en la que hay otro switch la velocidad cae dr√°sticamente. Probablemente sea m√°s culpa del switch pero no he conseguido dar con alguno que no de ese problema, cosa que no me ocurr√≠a con un router estandard de los de asus con 4 bocas. Tambi√©n he experimentado problemas y he tenido que reconfigurar equipos como un NAS y dem√°s En fin, para un instalaci√≥n simple de router y todo wifi m√°s acces point vale, pero no lo recomendar√≠a si tienes una configuraci√≥n algo m√°s compleja

EJEMPLO: Me he quedado un tanto decepcionado con el producto. Baja estabilidad, materiales poco resistentes, sensaci√≥n de poco recorrido hacen que lo pagado sea lo justo por lo recibido. Vistas las cr√≠ticas de anteriores compradores me esperaba m√°s. A√∫n me estoy pensando si estrenarlo o si directamente proceder a su devoluci√≥n.
RESPUESTA: neutro

EJEMPLO: Lo que no me a gustado es que no traiga un folleto de informaci√≥n del sistema de c√≥mo funciona
RESPUESTA: negativo

EJEMPLO: Lo compr√© para un regalo y ser√° utilizado con un iPhone X. No he tenido la oportunidad de probarlo con dicho tel√©fono, pero puedo hablar de la excelente calidad de los materiales, es pesado, se siente firme y tiene franjas con goma tanto en la parte superior para que el tel√©fono no se deslice y en su parte inferior para que no se deslice sobre la superficie donde se ubica. S√≥lo lo he conectado para probar las luces (azules) y si colocas un dispositivo para cargar, est√°s parpadean muy lentamente unas 5 veces y luego se apagan definitivamente, cosa que es de agradecer si lo vas a usar en tu mesa de noche. Por ahora lo recomiendo est√©ticamente, luego informar√© de su funcionamiento.
RESPUESTA: positivo

EJEMPLO: Producto con evidentes se√±ales de uso
RESPUESTA: negativo

EJEMPLO: Mi valoraci√≥n no es sobre el producto sino sobre AMAZON. Ofrec√©is el producto a 299‚Ç¨ y tras varios d√≠as me devolv√©is el dinero porque os hab√©is equivocado en el anuncio, seg√∫n vosotros, ahora es 399‚Ç¨. Es la primera vez que me ocurre esto. Cuando he comprado en cualquier sitio y el precio marcado no se correspond√≠a con el valor de caja siempre me lo han vendido con el precio marcado. Es inveros√≠mil lo ocurrido, pero la ultima palabra me la dar√° la oficina del consumidor
RESPUESTA: negativo

EJEMPLO: Es la tercera vez que publico una opini√≥n sobre este proyector y como la cr√≠tica es p√©sima parece ser que no me las han querido publicar. Me decid√≠ a comprarlo fi√°ndome de 3 opiniones positivas. Misteriosamente, despu√©s de escribir las dos opiniones fallidas y devolver el producto empezaron a aparecer decenas de comentarios EXCELENTES acerca de este proyector. Mi consejo es que no os fi√©is de las opiniones cuando adquir√°is un proyector chino.

EJEMPLO: Era un regalo y la verdad que esta dando la talla que deseaba!! Facil de utilizaci√≥n y muy creativo.
RESPUESTA: positivo

EJEMPLO: A los 3-4 dias dd haber llegado el telefono, la camara trasera dejo de funcionar. Me puse en contacto con ellos para tramitar un cambio, pero me pedian que devolviera este primero y luego ellos me mandaban otro, por lo que me quedaba sin movil, creo que lo mas conveniente es igual que viene el mensajero a traerme uno nuevo, a ma vez que se lleve el estropeado... no me podia quedar sin movil ya que solo tengo este y lo necesito. A dia de hoy todav√≠a ando con el movil sin camara trasera... un desastre. NO LO RECOMIENDO PARA NADA!
RESPUESTA: negativo

EJEMPLO: Est√° bien para el precio que tiene, no sirve para llevar cosas fr√≠as, el tama√±o es un poco justo, caben dos tuppers peque√±os y una lata

Argumenta tu respuesta paso a paso. En tu respuesta incluye s√≥lo el nombre de la clase, como una √∫nica respuesta

EJEMPLO: Aparentemente tiene muy buena calidad y un gran precio para venir tres protectores. Ning√∫n problema a nivel t√°ctil muy transparente, del tama√±o exacto para la pantalla. Sin embargo, el primero no fui capaz de que se adhiriera a la pantalla (quedaba despegado la mitad); pens√© que era mi inexperiencia. El segundo qued√≥ ya mejor, pero a√∫n y todo, no adherido del todo. Y ah√≠ ya no es por exceso de confianza. Gracias a que uso una funda tipo libro la pantalla no queda expuesta y he reservado el tercer protector para m√°s adelante.
RESPUESTA: neutro

EJEMPLO: El cristal le va peque√±o a la pantalla, por los lados sobra un monton as√≠ que no lo cubre por completo, uno de los 2 cristales que iban en el paquete llevaba como una mota de polvo de fabrica insalvable. No lo recomiendo.
RESPUESTA: negativo

EJEMPLO: La facil instalacion y la calidad del mismo
RESPUESTA: positivo

EJEMPLO: Un desastre de producto. Los globos imposibles de inchar, sin instrucciones, Valvulas imposibles y que se rompen. No lo recomiendo en absoluto.
RESPUESTA: negativo

EJEMPLO: Cumple su prop√≥sito aunque son bastante endebles, hay que poner prendas ligeras si no se abren por el peso.
RESPUESTA: neutro

EJEMPLO: Son dos pantallas protectoras bastante f√°ciles de instalar. Vienen en una cajita muy elegante con un mont√≥n de complementos e instrucciones sencillas para que puedas instalarlas con suma facilidad. No se ensucian mucho y aguantan bastante.

RESPUESTA: neutro

EJEMPLO: Es un disfraz que solo entra la parte de arriba del traje, viene con una m√°scara d l√°tex gruesa que viene toda doblada y deforme. Pero eso no es lo peor, lo peor es que el traje cuesta 45‚Ç¨ y deber√≠an de darte 45‚Ç¨ por pon√©rtelo, por que es un espanto para el precio que tiene, una tela p√©sima, como un traje de carnaval del bazar oriental de 6‚Ç¨. Y lo de la talla √∫nica... u√±a persona que tenga una complexi√≥n algo fuerte, no le estar√≠a bien. De verdad, es un traje que no vale en absoluto el dinero que cuesta.

EJEMPLO: Magn√≠fico cable recibe la se√±al perfectamente.
RESPUESTA: positivo

EJEMPLO: Me he quedado un tanto decepcionado con el producto. Baja estabilidad, materiales poco resistentes, sensaci√≥n de poco recorrido hacen que lo pagado sea lo justo por lo recibido.

Argumenta tu respuesta paso a paso. En tu respuesta incluye s√≥lo el nombre de la clase, como una √∫nica respuesta

EJEMPLO: Lo compr√© para un regalo y ser√° utilizado con un iPhone X. No he tenido la oportunidad de probarlo con dicho tel√©fono, pero puedo hablar de la excelente calidad de los materiales, es pesado, se siente firme y tiene franjas con goma tanto en la parte superior para que el tel√©fono no se deslice y en su parte inferior para que no se deslice sobre la superficie donde se ubica. S√≥lo lo he conectado para probar las luces (azules) y si colocas un dispositivo para cargar, est√°s parpadean muy lentamente unas 5 veces y luego se apagan definitivamente, cosa que es de agradecer si lo vas a usar en tu mesa de noche. Por ahora lo recomiendo est√©ticamente, luego informar√© de su funcionamiento.
RESPUESTA: positivo

EJEMPLO: Estaria bien que fuese mas largo el hueco pars que no se quede tsn colgado el pints labios. Cumple su funcion si no tienes mucho dinero.
RESPUESTA: neutro

EJEMPLO: Buenos materiales. Gran sonido. Sin problemas de conexi√≥n con ning√∫n dispositivo Bluetooth que he probado. Los leds le dan un toque chic.
RESPUESTA: neutro

EJEMPLO: Pues me dej√© guiar por las buenas opiniones y al final ha sido un triunfazo!! a todos en casa les ha encantado. F√°cil de instalar. Todo en √©l es met√°lico lo que le da robustez. He probado un poco el sonido y bueno no hay color de grabar con este micr√≥fono a uno de auriculares que usaba antes, lo que si aconsejo que no lo pongais muy cerca de la torre del ordenador y m√°s si es antigua porque por muy bueno que sea el micro milagros no hace jeje Viene con un usb que por ejemplo yo lo usar√© para ponerlo en el portatil y poder conectarle el microfono y unos auriculares y as√≠ poder editar con √©l.
RESPUESTA: positivo

EJEMPLO: la tela no es la que esperaba
RESPUESTA: neutro

EJEMPLO: No s√© qui√©n puede estar interesado en semejante producto. Casi ninguna de las funciones funcionan. Lo que funciona es la calculadora,el reproductor de m√∫sica, lo de contar los pasos y poco m√°s. No sirve para nada poder mandar SMS, que cuestan dinero y nadie utiliza casi para nada, si no puedes utilizar el whatsapp, que es lo que todos tenemos y necesitamos. Ni whatsapp ni facebook, ni nada se puede usar. El reloj necesitar√≠a otra tarjeta SIM para hacer llamadas sin conectarse al tel√©fono por bluetooth pero eso significa que te cobrar√°n unos cuatro euros m√°s en tu operador de telefonia cada mes. El bluetooth es mal√≠simo y no llega ni a unos cent√≠metros, con lo cual no me llegaba ni de la mu√±eca hasta los cascos de las orejas. Para correr y escuchar m√∫sica y mirar la hora...te durar√° media hora y eso con suerte y si tienes la suerte de que te llegue la se√±al a tus cascos desde el brazo. Muy muy muy decepcionada con este producto. Devuelto al d√≠a siguiente. Una tomadura de pelo.

RESPUESTA: neutro

RESPUESTA: positivo

EJEMPLO: Esta buen, queda bien en el ordenador lo deja muy protegido pero la calidad del pl√°stico se ve que no es muy buena y que en s√≠ no parece madera de verdad ni anda cerca de parecerlo. Tambi√©n tengo que decir que la carcasa que me vino es diferente a la de la foto esta es m√°s clarita.

RESPUESTA: neutro

EJEMPLO: Encaja perfectamente y cubre todo el tel√©fono, no se desliza y es muy limpia, la √∫nica pega es que el pl√°stico es muy duro y los botones de los laterales est√°n cubiertos y tienes que hacer mucha fuerza para pulsarlos. Otra cosa que no me acaba de convencer es el dibujo interior que deber√≠a ser completamente liso.

EJEMPLO: Para empezar, si el tiempo de env√≠o es largo, el producto se retrasa por problema de aduanas. Solicit√≥ la devoluci√≥n, ya que es para un regalo y ante la tardanza han adquirido una prenda similar en otro sitio. Amazon me pone en contacto con el vendedor, el cual no facilita la devoluci√≥n. Mientras tanto recibo el paquete y cu√°l es mi sorpresa que el art√≠culo q me env√≠an es un bolso negro, una especie de portafolios pero que nada tiene que ver con el sujetador de lactancia que encargue. Sigo en contacto con el vendedor, que a√∫n sigue sin darme ninguna soluci√≥n.

EJEMPLO: Muy buen producto. Viene con pilas para la luz. Muy estable y practico. La verdad es que lo recomiendo totalmente
RESPUESTA: positivo

EJEMPLO: Lo compr√© para un regalo y ser√° utilizado con un iPhone X. No he tenido la oportunidad de probarlo con dicho tel√©fono, pero puedo hablar de la excelente calidad de los materiales, es pesado, se siente firme y tiene franjas con goma tanto en la parte superior para que el tel√©fono no se deslice y en su parte inferior para que no se deslice sobre la superficie donde se ubica. S√≥lo lo he conectado para probar las luces (azules) y si colocas un dispositivo para cargar, est√°s parpadean muy lentamente unas 5 veces y luego se apagan definitivamente, cosa que es de agradecer si lo vas a usar en tu mesa de noche. Por ahora lo recomiendo est√©ticamente, luego informar√© de su funcionamiento.

Para esto esta genial, te libera las manos y puedes trabajar. Realmente vale para mucho mas, ya que tiene 2 intensidades de luz, intermitencias y luz roja atras. Como fallo dir√© que no me gusta que las pilar recargables no sean de un tama√±o estandar. Es decir, son mucho mas grandes que las pilas normales y si alg√∫n dia se estropean desconozco si se podr√°n encontrar facilmente. Espero que duren muchos a√±os. Como se ve en la foto, el producto biene muy completo.

Luz para el olvido me ha sorprendido positivamente por su f√°cil y amena lectura de principio a fin, he disfrutado y he aprendido mucho, a la vez que el, capit√°n m√©dico Luis Mar√≠a Alonso me ha sorprendido por su car√°cter, su fuerte personalidad, su confianza en sus principios y su fidelidad a los mismos, fue tanta su honestidad consigo mismo que le cost√≥ la vida. Considero que es una lecci√≥n de historia recomendable para todos los espa√±oles que quieran aprender y disfrutar con la lectura.

EJEMPLO: Despu√©s de unos meses de uso cambio mi valoraci√≥n seguido de mi opini√≥n: El dispensador ha dejado de funcionar correctamente, el vendedor s√≥lo me contest√≥ para preguntarme por el n√∫mero de pedido, una vez se lo dije... no he vuelto a saber nada mas de el, ni ha dado soluciones, ni mucho menos ha intentado buscarlas o averiguar por que falla. Por otro lado destacar que ha empezado a oxidarse... Raro ya que el anuncio pon√≠a claramente de Acero Inoxidable... ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ La tecnolog√≠a llega a nuestras casas... hace unos meses compr√© una papelera/basura tambi√©n con sensor de proximidad y apertura autom√°tica. Quede muy contento y me arriesgue con este dispensador de jab√≥n. La principal caracter√≠stica y ventaja es que no &#34;pringas&#34; nada. Puedes tener las manos llenas de jab√≥n o agua y solo con aproximar la mano al sensor el dispensador se activa. Es muy f√°cil de utilizar, dispone de dos botones, + y - estos sirven para graduar la descarga del dispensador. Pulsando m√°s de 3 segundos el +, podemos encenderlo o apagarlo. La carga se efect√∫a por la parte superior desde un tap√≥n de media rosca. Destacar que el dispensador utiliza 4 pilas del tipo A++ que no van incluidas en el paquete.

EJEMPLO: Es un disfraz que solo entra la parte de arriba del traje, viene con una m√°scara d l√°tex gruesa que viene toda doblada y deforme. Pero eso no es lo peor, lo peor es que el traje cuesta 45‚Ç¨ y deber√≠an de darte 45‚Ç¨ por pon√©rtelo, por que es un espanto para el precio que tiene, una tela p√©sima, como un traje de carnaval del bazar oriental de 6‚Ç¨.

Para algunos usos quiz√° sea mejor no tener un sabor tan fuerte, pero para temas de salud preferir√≠a tener todo el espectro natural.

EJEMPLO: La funda para el sof√° es muy fina. El material no transmite sensaci√≥n de que vaya a durar en el tiempo, pero por el precio que tiene no podr√≠a pedirse algo mejor, o si?. Compr√© una funda de marca para la barbacoa y comprado con esta es de risa. En principio hace de repelente de agua, pero no lo he probado con lluvia torrencial, lo he probado tir√°ndole un poco de agua en una zona con un vaso. Habr√≠a que volver a valorar esta funda con el paso del tiempo para ver si merece la pena o no su compra.
RESPUESTA: neutro

EJEMPLO: El armario est√° bastante bien. Pero el tema de mensajeria deja mucho que desear, aunque llego relativamente rapido (algo menos de 2 semanas), vino con varios golpes los cuales dificultan el montaje e interrumpen el cierre y apertura de puertas
RESPUESTA: neutro

EJEMPLO: Estaba buscando unos cuchillos de carne que me durasen para much√≠simo tiempo sin importarme gastar un poco m√°s. A veces es mejor no comprar barato. Estos cuchillos van a sustituir a unos antiguos que ten√≠a que aunque hac√≠an bien su funci√≥n se me fueron estropeando porque el mango era de pl√°stico y de tanto lavado se fue estropeando esta parte. A primera vista ya se aprecia que son de muy buena calidad por los materiales con los que est√°n fabricados. A destacar tambi√©n el envoltorio ya que son perfectos para regalar. Muy buena compra.

RESPUESTA: positivo

EJEMPLO: Le hab√≠a dado cinco estrellas y una opini√≥n muy positiva, el aparato funcion√≥ bien mientras funcion√≥, el problema es que funcion√≥ poco tiempo. Hoy, apenas tres meses despu√©s de adquirirlo, he ido a encenderlo y en lugar de arrancar se ha quedado parado. Unos segundos m√°s tarde ha soltado un chispazo y ah√≠ se ha quedado. No se le ha dado ning√∫n golpe, ni se ha usado para nada distinto a su finalidad, as√≠ que la √∫nica explicaci√≥n l√≥gica es que viniera defectuoso de f√°brica. Amazon me va a reembolsar el importe en garant√≠a en cuanto lo devuelva, as√≠ que por ese lado no tengo queja.
RESPUESTA: negativo

EJEMPLO: Leyendo las opiniones de otros compradores no sabia que esperar. Las habia buenas y malas. Yo me quede a medias. Pense que se quedaria mas cerrado, y aunque aun no lo he probado con frutos secos (almendras...) que era principalmente para lo que lo queria, el sistema de cierre que tiene no me da ninguna seguridad. Para cosas de mayor tama√±o si lo veo adecuado para transportarlas (manzana, platano...) Si en lugar de un unico velcro, la tapa tuviese dos velcros si lo veria seguro (posiblemente me haga yo un apa√±o casero)

EJEMPLO: Aparentemente tiene muy buena calidad y un gran precio para venir tres protectores. Ning√∫n problema a nivel t√°ctil muy transparente, del tama√±o exacto para la pantalla. Sin embargo, el primero no fui capaz de que se adhiriera a la pantalla (quedaba despegado la mitad); pens√© que era mi inexperiencia.

Chicos no lo compr√©is si no quer√©is joder vuestro tel√©fono m√≥vil. Horrible el producto.
RESPUESTA: negativo

EJEMPLO: Compr√© el protector para el m√≥vil de mi hija... en menos de 2 meses tiene ya la pantalla rota, sin golpes bruscos ni caidas de m√≥vil, eso si el protector intacto. No parece que proteja mucho

EJEMPLO: He probado varios auriculares ya. Estos sin duda son los que mejor resultado dan en cuanto a sonido y comodidad se refiere. Totalmente recomendable.
RESPUESTA: positivo

EJEMPLO: Buen precio para la gran capacidad que tiene. No tiene ruido y es totalmente manejable.
RESPUESTA: positivo

EJEMPLO: Cuando una marca de prestigio pone un producto al mercado uno espera un m√≠nimo de calidad, Samsung Galaxy Fit e , no lo √©s. Tiene varios problemas, pero el m√°s significativo es que a la hora de deslizar las pantallas con el dedo te das cuenta que no funciona o que lo hace aveces, creo que Samsung no ha estado a la altura de lo que de ellos se espera. El √∫nico consuelo que nos queda es que estos fallos puedan ser corregidos por una actualizaci√≥n, y as√≠ disfrutar y no desesperarse de esta pulsera que por dise√±o merecer√≠a un mejor trato de su fabricante.
RESPUESTA: negativo

EJEMPLO: Los auriculares tienen un dise√±o atractivo, se emparejan facilmente y funcionan bien. Pero el audio es muy mejorable, tiene un sonido enlatado completamente, tambi√©n puede ser porque estoy acostumbrado a los del iphone que sinceramente se escuchan muy muy bien. Pero en cuanto al audio de unos auriculares soy bastante exigente.

S√≥lo lo he conectado para probar las luces (azules) y si colocas un dispositivo para cargar, est√°s parpadean muy lentamente unas 5 veces y luego se apagan definitivamente, cosa que es de agradecer si lo vas a usar en tu mesa de noche.

EJEMPLO: Me he quedado un tanto decepcionado con el producto. Baja estabilidad, materiales poco resistentes, sensaci√≥n de poco recorrido hacen que lo pagado sea lo justo por lo recibido. Vistas las cr√≠ticas de anteriores compradores me esperaba m√°s. A√∫n me estoy pensando si estrenarlo o si directamente proceder a su devoluci√≥n.
RESPUESTA: neutro

EJEMPLO: Lo que no me a gustado es que no traiga un folleto de informaci√≥n del sistema de c√≥mo funciona
RESPUESTA: negativo

EJEMPLO: Lo compr√© para un regalo y ser√° utilizado con un iPhone X. No he tenido la oportunidad de probarlo con dicho tel√©fono, pero puedo hablar de la excelente calidad de los materiales, es pesado, se siente firme y tiene franjas con goma tanto en la parte superior para que el tel√©fono no se deslice y en su parte inferior para que no se deslice sobre la superficie donde se ubica. S√≥lo lo he conectado para probar las luces (azules) y si colocas un dispositivo para cargar, est√°s parpadean muy lentamente unas 5 veces y luego se apagan definitivamente, cosa que es de agradecer si lo vas a usar en tu mesa de noche. Por ahora lo recomiendo est√©ticamente, luego informar√© de su funcionamiento.
RESPUESTA: positivo

EJEMPLO: Producto con evidentes se√±ales de uso
RESPUESTA: negativo

EJEMPLO: Mi valoraci√≥n no es sobre el producto sino sobre AMAZON. Ofrec√©is el producto a 299‚Ç¨ y tras varios d√≠as me devolv√©is el dinero porque os hab√©is equivocado en el anuncio, seg√∫n vosotros, ahora es 399‚Ç¨. Es la primera vez que me ocurre esto. Cuando he comprado en cualquier sitio y el precio marcado no se correspond√≠a con el valor de caja siempre me lo han vendido con el precio marcado. Es inveros√≠mil lo ocurrido, pero la ultima palabra me la dar√° la oficina del consumidor
RESPUESTA: negativo

EJEMPLO: Es la tercera vez que publico una opini√≥n sobre este proyector y como la cr√≠tica es p√©sima parece ser que no me las han querido publicar. Me decid√≠ a comprarlo fi√°ndome de 3 opiniones positivas. Misteriosamente, despu√©s de escribir las dos opiniones fallidas y devolver el producto empezaron a aparecer decenas de comentarios EXCELENTES acerca de este proyector. Mi consejo es que no os fi√©is de las opiniones cuando adquir√°is un proyector chino.

EJEMPLO: Aparentemente tiene muy buena calidad y un gran precio para venir tres protectores. Ning√∫n problema a nivel t√°ctil muy transparente, del tama√±o exacto para la pantalla. Sin embargo, el primero no fui capaz de que se adhiriera a la pantalla (quedaba despegado la mitad); pens√© que era mi inexperiencia. El segundo qued√≥ ya mejor, pero a√∫n y todo, no adherido del todo. Y ah√≠ ya no es por exceso de confianza. Gracias a que uso una funda tipo libro la pantalla no queda expuesta y he reservado el tercer protector para m√°s adelante.
RESPUESTA: neutro

EJEMPLO: El cristal le va peque√±o a la pantalla, por los lados sobra un monton as√≠ que no lo cubre por completo, uno de los 2 cristales que iban en el paquete llevaba como una mota de polvo de fabrica insalvable. No lo recomiendo.

EJEMPLO: No cubre toda la pantalla. La margen negra tapa la laterales como un medio mm.
RESPUESTA: negativo

EJEMPLO: Estaba buscando unos cuchillos de carne que me durasen para much√≠simo tiempo sin importarme gastar un poco m√°s. A veces es mejor no comprar barato. Estos cuchillos van a sustituir a unos antiguos que ten√≠a que aunque hac√≠an bien su funci√≥n se me fueron estropeando porque el mango era de pl√°stico y de tanto lavado se fue estropeando esta parte. A primera vista ya se aprecia que son de muy buena calidad por los materiales con los que est√°n fabricados. A destacar tambi√©n el envoltorio ya que son perfectos para regalar. Muy buena compra.
RESPUESTA: positivo

EJEMPLO: F√°cil de conectar, peque√±o y manejable. El sonido regular y se oye bastante flojito. No lo volver√≠a a comprar.

EJEMPLO: Todav√≠a no he tenido tiempo de probarlo, a tener en cuenta que no lleva pilas, hay que comprarlas , son de las peque√±as no de las de boton sino de las otras.
RESPUESTA: neutro

EJEMPLO: Es un disfraz que solo entra la parte de arriba del traje, viene con una m√°scara d l√°tex gruesa que viene toda doblada y deforme. Pero eso no es lo peor, lo peor es que el traje cuesta 45‚Ç¨ y deber√≠an de darte 45‚Ç¨ por pon√©rtelo, por que es un espanto para el precio que tiene, una tela p√©sima, como un traje de carnaval del bazar oriental de 6‚Ç¨. Y lo de la talla √∫nica... u√±a persona que tenga una complexi√≥n algo fuerte, no le estar√≠a bien. De verdad, es un traje que no vale en absoluto el dinero que cuesta.

S√≥lo lo he conectado para probar las luces (azules) y si colocas un dispositivo para cargar, est√°s parpadean muy lentamente unas 5 veces y luego se apagan definitivamente, cosa que es de agradecer si lo vas a usar en tu mesa de noche.

RESPUESTA: neutro

EJEMPLO: Magn√≠fico cable recibe la se√±al perfectamente.
RESPUESTA: positivo

EJEMPLO: Me he quedado un tanto decepcionado con el producto. Baja estabilidad, materiales poco resistentes, sensaci√≥n de poco recorrido hacen que lo pagado sea lo justo por lo recibido. Vistas las cr√≠ticas de anteriores compradores me esperaba m√°s. A√∫n me estoy pensando si estrenarlo o si directamente proceder a su devoluci√≥n.
RESPUESTA: neutro

EJEMPLO: Todo correcto, Muy recomendable. Buena opci√≥n para tener cables de reserva. Envio rapidisimo! Excelente relaci√≥n calidad/precio. Recomendable para la empresa y en casa.
RESPUESTA: positivo

EJEMPLO: Ha venido con el cerdito suelto y limado en ciertas zonas, la caja obviamente rota. Si lo quieres para exponer, exige mayor cuidado a la hora de la compra.
RESPUESTA: neutro

Los botones que lleva dan la sensaci√≥n que se van a romper cuando los pulsas, la tapa que tienes que quitar para sacar el recipiente luego no encaja y te tiras media hora para volverla a poner en su sitio. El agua a veces se sale y la placa electr√≥nica que lleva el aparato no est√° protegida, te doy 2 d√≠as para que se rompa, esto es un timo se√±ores, no malgasten su dinero, ni 5‚Ç¨ vale, le doy una estrella porque me obligan.

A dia de hoy todav√≠a ando con el movil sin camara trasera... un desastre. NO LO RECOMIENDO PARA NADA!
RESPUESTA: negativo

EJEMPLO: No me ha gustado para nada el producto ya que las burbujas que hace se quedan y no se quitan como dicen en la descripci√≥n (pasadas 48 horas ) No lo recomiendo para nada
RESPUESTA: negativo

EJEMPLO: No s√© qui√©n puede estar interesado en semejante producto. Casi ninguna de las funciones funcionan. Lo que funciona es la calculadora,el reproductor de m√∫sica, lo de contar los pasos y poco m√°s. No sirve para nada poder mandar SMS, que cuestan dinero y nadie utiliza casi para nada, si no puedes utilizar el whatsapp, que es lo que todos tenemos y necesitamos. Ni whatsapp ni facebook, ni nada se puede usar. El reloj necesitar√≠a otra tarjeta SIM para hacer llamadas sin conectarse al tel√©fono por bluetooth pero eso significa que te cobrar√°n unos cuatro euros m√°s en tu operador de telefonia cada mes. El bluetooth es mal√≠simo y no llega ni a unos cent√≠metros, con lo cual no me llegaba ni de la mu√±eca hasta los cascos de las orejas. Para correr y escuchar m√∫sica y mirar la hora...te durar√° media hora y eso con suerte y si tienes la suerte de que te llegue la se√±al a tus cascos desde el brazo. Muy muy muy decepcionada con este producto. Devuelto al d√≠a siguiente. Una tomadura de pelo.

Mientras tanto recibo el paquete y cu√°l es mi sorpresa que el art√≠culo q me env√≠an es un bolso negro, una especie de portafolios pero que nada tiene que ver con el sujetador de lactancia que encargue. Sigo en contacto con el vendedor, que a√∫n sigue sin darme ninguna soluci√≥n.

EJEMPLO: El armario est√° bastante bien. Pero el tema de mensajeria deja mucho que desear, aunque llego relativamente rapido (algo menos de 2 semanas), vino con varios golpes los cuales dificultan el montaje e interrumpen el cierre y apertura de puertas
RESPUESTA: neutro

EJEMPLO: El reloj est√° bien, se ve muy bien la hora, tiene buen dise√±o, los pl√°sticos no parecen muy malos, para el precio que tiene estar√≠a muy bien excepto sino fuera por un detalle. La hebilla sobresale mucho, se me clava en la mu√±eca y eso que lo he llevado bastante suelto.
RESPUESTA: neutro

EJEMPLO: Env√≠o r√°pido pero la bolsa viene sin caja ( en otras tiendas online viene mejor empaquetado) y por consecuencia la bolsa ten√≠a varios puntos con agujeros... La comida est√° en buen estado pero ya no te da la misma confianza. Fecha de caducidad correcta.

EJEMPLO: Despu√©s de unos meses de uso cumple su funci√≥n. Materiales y acabados buenos, lo que no me gusta es que la ventana es muy oscura y cuesta ver la hora
RESPUESTA: neutro

EJEMPLO: Pegan muy bien a la base con el velcro, las he usado con madera y para pulir resina epoxi y van de lujo, compr√© tambien la base del taladro, la engancho a la mesa y a trabajar.
RESPUESTA: positivo

EJEMPLO: Tiene el tubo muy peque√±o, no sirve ni para botellas de 1 Litro. Viene empaquetado doblado lo cual facilita que se rompan los cables interiores del tubo. Un desastre y vale mucho m√°s el envio que el producto en si.
RESPUESTA: negativo

EJEMPLO: Es c√≥modo de buen material y se adapta perfectamente a la Tablet. Buen dise√±o agradable al tacto. El tr√≠pode tambi√©n es de utilidad.
RESPUESTA: positivo

EJEMPLO: La calidad no es muy buena. A la primera puesta le han salido un mont√≥n de bolas y me ha dejado el colch√≥n lleno de pelusas como se puede ver en la foto adjunta. Adem√°s, los laterales no viene con costura. No lo recomiendo.
RESPUESTA: negativo

EJEMPLO: El cristal le va peque√±o a la pantalla, por los lados sobra un monton as√≠ que no lo cubre por completo, uno de los 2 cristales que iban en el paquete llevaba como una mota de polvo de fabrica insalvable. No lo recomiendo.
RESPUESTA: negativo

EJEMPLO: Las compr√© para aguas abiertas, muy buenas gafas una vez que las ajustas bien. Por el material parece que entre agua, pero no. Una gran ventaja que tengan lentes polarizadas, van muy bien cuando da el sol de cara. Muy buen producto, ya veremos cuanto dura la estanqueidad.
RESPUESTA: positivo

EJEMPLO: Queda un poco holgada para una cama de 150, no se ajusta del todo. El blanco no es que sea muy blanco y estas s√°banas de Amazon Basics tienen todas mucha electricidad est√°tica, recomiendo lavarlas antes de ponerlas, si no, producen muchas chispas.
RESPUESTA: neutro

EJEMPLO: Esta bien, es fino, queda mas grande de lo que se indica en el tallaje. El gorro tambi√©n es grande.
RESPUESTA: neutro

EJEMPLO: Las figuras son aleatorias y vale lo mismo que en cualquier tienda/kiosco. Por lo tanto si lo coge el ni√±o en la tienda puede ver si los tiene o no. En la foto salen los m√°s dif√≠ciles de conseguir, los que quieren los ni√±os, y luego vienen los que les parece. Repito, no merece la pena comprarlos por aqu√≠, todo son inconvenientes.
RESPUESTA: negativo

EJEMPLO: Es bonito y el acabado de las tablas est√° bien (mejor que muchos de IKEA). No ocurre lo mismo con el de las varillas, que se raya con mirarlo y ya ven√≠a algo tocado del roce en la caja. El problema es que la varilla donde cuelgan las perchas, si son de metal, con seguridad lo va a desconchar. El montaje normal, al estilo IKEA, con instrucciones claras y herramientas necesarias. Con el uso iremos viendo el agua te de la rosca de los tornillos.

Mientras tanto recibo el paquete y cu√°l es mi sorpresa que el art√≠culo q me env√≠an es un bolso negro, una especie de portafolios pero que nada tiene que ver con el sujetador de lactancia que encargue.

He probado un poco el sonido y bueno no hay color de grabar con este micr√≥fono a uno de auriculares que usaba antes, lo que si aconsejo que no lo pongais muy cerca de la torre del ordenador y m√°s si es antigua porque por muy bueno que sea el micro milagros no hace jeje Viene con un usb que por ejemplo yo lo usar√© para ponerlo en el portatil y poder conectarle el microfono y unos auriculares y as√≠ poder editar con √©l.

EJEMPLO: Muy buen producto. Viene con pilas para la luz. Muy estable y practico. La verdad es que lo recomiendo totalmente
RESPUESTA: positivo

EJEMPLO: Lo compr√© para un regalo y ser√° utilizado con un iPhone X. No he tenido la oportunidad de probarlo con dicho tel√©fono, pero puedo hablar de la excelente calidad de los materiales, es pesado, se siente firme y tiene franjas con goma tanto en la parte superior para que el tel√©fono no se deslice y en su parte inferior para que no se deslice sobre la superficie donde se ubica. S√≥lo lo he conectado para probar las luces (azules) y si colocas un dispositivo para cargar, est√°s parpadean muy lentamente unas 5 veces y luego se apagan definitivamente, cosa que es de agradecer si lo vas a usar en tu mesa de noche. Por ahora lo recomiendo est√©ticamente, luego informar√© de su funcionamiento.

Para esto esta genial, te libera las manos y puedes trabajar. Realmente vale para mucho mas, ya que tiene 2 intensidades de luz, intermitencias y luz roja atras. Como fallo dir√© que no me gusta que las pilar recargables no sean de un tama√±o estandar. Es decir, son mucho mas grandes que las pilas normales y si alg√∫n dia se estropean desconozco si se podr√°n encontrar facilmente. Espero que duren muchos a√±os.

EJEMPLO: Me ha gustado mucho el producto. El dise√±o y calidad muy buenos. El pedido lleg√≥ muy rapido. Me ha encantado
RESPUESTA: positivo

EJEMPLO: Para empezar, si el tiempo de env√≠o es largo, el producto se retrasa por problema de aduanas. Solicit√≥ la devoluci√≥n, ya que es para un regalo y ante la tardanza han adquirido una prenda similar en otro sitio. Amazon me pone en contacto con el vendedor, el cual no facilita la devoluci√≥n. Mientras tanto recibo el paquete y cu√°l es mi sorpresa que el art√≠culo q me env√≠an es un bolso negro, una especie de portafolios pero que nada tiene que ver con el sujetador de lactancia que encargue. Sigo en contacto con el vendedor, que a√∫n sigue sin darme ninguna soluci√≥n.
RESPUESTA: negativo

EJEMPLO: A pesar de estar tom√°ndome este producto durante dos meses y medio religiosamente cada d√≠a ,no sirve absolutamente de nada, porque sigo blanca como la pared. Admiro a las personas que lo han tomado y les ha funcionado pero desde luego a m√≠, no ha sido el caso.

RESPUESTA: negativo

EJEMPLO: Es un aut√©ntico timo, pl√°stico de mal√≠sima calidad, lleva un ventilador de muy baja potencia, es de Pc, he metido el recipiente al congelador y ni poni√©ndole hielo enfria, imag√≠nate con agua. Los botones que lleva dan la sensaci√≥n que se van a romper cuando los pulsas, la tapa que tienes que quitar para sacar el recipiente luego no encaja y te tiras media hora para volverla a poner en su sitio. El agua a veces se sale y la placa electr√≥nica que lleva el aparato no est√° protegida, te doy 2 d√≠as para que se rompa, esto es un timo se√±ores, no malgasten su dinero, ni 5‚Ç¨ vale, le doy una estrella porque me obligan.
RESPUESTA: negativo

EJEMPLO: Me he quedado un tanto decepcionado con el producto. Baja estabilidad, materiales poco resistentes, sensaci√≥n de poco recorrido hacen que lo pagado sea lo justo por lo recibido.

EJEMPLO: Muy liviano, el material parece hojalata. Muy bonito por dentro y por fuera. El casquillo es bastante pobre. El cable y embellecedor est√°n correctos. Pero se come casi toda la luz de la bombilla, necesita muchisima potencia para que de luminosidad. Y es una luz muy muy anaranjada. Si quieres un ambiente tenue, ok.

EJEMPLO: La peor c√°mara que he tenido en mis manos. Dos veces la he tenido que reemplazar al primer d√≠a de uso. Al final con la mitad de accesorios comprados la he tenido que devolver y no comprarla m√°s. La c√°mara se queda congelada. Se cargaba la bater√≠a cuando ella quer√≠a y se descargaba sola sin usarla. Problemas de actualizaci√≥n, vamos si quieres tirar el dinero c√≥mprate est√° c√°mara. Una gran decepci√≥n. Esperaba que est√° c√°mara funcionara bien pero ha sido una pesadilla. Amazon me dijo que la iba a quitar de la venta por que hab√≠a much√≠simas devoluciones de esta c√°mara

EJEMPLO: Despu√©s de unos meses de uso cumple su funci√≥n. Materiales y acabados buenos, lo que no me gusta es que la ventana es muy oscura y cuesta ver la hora
RESPUESTA: neutro

EJEMPLO: Las compr√© para aguas abiertas, muy buenas gafas una vez que las ajustas bien. Por el material parece que entre agua, pero no. Una gran ventaja que tengan lentes polarizadas, van muy bien cuando da el sol de cara. Muy buen producto, ya veremos cuanto dura la estanqueidad.
RESPUESTA: positivo

RESPUESTA: neutro

EJEMPLO: Aparentemente es bonito y f√°cil de colocar, pero cuando sales a la calle y lo tienes que usarlo para advertir alg√∫n peat√≥n que se cruza despistado o deseas avisar, para poder pasar o adelantar. El sonido es muy d√©bil insuficiente para una ciudad o pueblo. Es una pena el producto es bonito pero no merece la pena comprarlo.

EJEMPLO: Es un aut√©ntico timo, pl√°stico de mal√≠sima calidad, lleva un ventilador de muy baja potencia, es de Pc, he metido el recipiente al congelador y ni poni√©ndole hielo enfria, imag√≠nate con agua. Los botones que lleva dan la sensaci√≥n que se van a romper cuando los pulsas, la tapa que tienes que quitar para sacar el recipiente luego no encaja y te tiras media hora para volverla a poner en su sitio. El agua a veces se sale y la placa electr√≥nica que lleva el aparato no est√° protegida, te doy 2 d√≠as para que se rompa, esto es un timo se√±ores, no malgasten su dinero, ni 5‚Ç¨ vale, le doy una estrella porque me obligan.
RESPUESTA: negativo

EJEMPLO: Ya hab√≠a probado varios aparatos de este tipo y este supera todos los que ya he tenido . Es muy c√≥modo que sea recargable y no de pilas como la mayor√≠a. Pero adem√°s el mango giratorio es una comodidad.
RESPUESTA: positivo

EJEMPLO: Practico, parece que no se debe oxidar con el agua, se engancha como si fuera una percha a un grifo o similar, pero la ventosa inferior no pega con la fuerza necesaria y se desplaza. Ojo si el enganche es prominente los estantes quedar√°n muy separados de la pared y se caer√°n por detr√°s

EJEMPLO: El producto y su propia caja en el que viene empaquetado los botes es bueno, pero la caja del env√≠o del trasporte es horrible. La caja del transporte llego completamente rota. De tal manera que los botes me los entregaron por un lado y la caja por otro. El transporte era de SEUR, muy mal.
RESPUESTA: neutro

EJEMPLO: Es justo lo que buscaba ni m√°s ni menos y adem√°s es como la que ten√≠a de hace ya a√±os.
RESPUESTA: positivo

EJEMPLO: Despues de 2 dias esperando la entrega ,tuve que ir a buscarlo a la central de DHL de tarragona ,pese a haber pagado gastos de envio (10 euros),y encima me encuentro con un paquete todo golpeado en el que faltan partes del embalaje de carton y el resto esta sujeto por multitud de tiras de celo gigantesco pata que no se desmonte el resto de la caja ,nefasto he hecho varias reclamaciones a la empresa de transporte y encima me encuentro el paquete en unas condiciones horrorosas con multiples golpes,espero que al menos funcione.Nada recomendable,ni el vendedor ni amazon ni por supuesto el transportista DHL.
RESPUESTA: negativo

EJEMPLO: A pesar de estar tom√°ndome este producto durante dos meses y medio religiosamente cada d√≠a ,no sirve absolutamente de nada, porque sigo blanca como la pared. Admiro a las personas que lo han tomado y les ha funcionado pero desde luego a m√≠, no ha sido el caso. Dec√≠an que empezaba a funcionar desde el segundo mes pero pienso que aunque lo tomase 12 meses seguir√≠a igual.
RESPUESTA: negativo

EJEMPLO: Por lo que cuesta, no est√° mal, recomendable su compra, como producto asequible.
RESPUESTA: neutro

EJEMPLO: Para empezar, si el tiempo de env√≠o es largo, el producto se retrasa por problema de aduanas. Solicit√≥ la devoluci√≥n, ya que es para un regalo y ante la tardanza han adquirido una prenda similar en otro sitio. Amazon me pone en contacto con el vendedor, el cual no facilita la devoluci√≥n. Mientras tanto recibo el paquete y cu√°l es mi sorpresa que el art√≠culo q me env√≠an es un bolso negro, una especie de portafolios pero que nada tiene que ver con el sujetador de lactancia que encargue. Sigo en contacto con el vendedor, que a√∫n sigue sin darme ninguna soluci√≥n.
RESPUESTA: negativo

EJEMPLO: La tarta es un poco peque√±a y los complementos m√°s aun. Me esperaba otra cosa. Pero est√° bien. Es pl√°stico todo

RESPUESTA: negativo

EJEMPLO: Es muy peque√±a y tard√≥ bastante en llegar. Pienso que es una pieza m√°s para aire que para agua. El paso es muy peque√±o.

EJEMPLO: La idea es muy buena y facilita especialmente la cocci√≥n a baja temperatura en Crock Pot. Yo he utilizado la rejilla con el pollo asado y el pulled pork. El resultado era muy bueno pero al mes de utilizarlo han aparecido manchas de √≥xido. No recomiendo su compra por la corta duraci√≥n. Deber√≠a ser de acero inoxidable.

RESPUESTA: negativo

EJEMPLO: Le hab√≠a dado cinco estrellas y una opini√≥n muy positiva, el aparato funcion√≥ bien mientras funcion√≥, el problema es que funcion√≥ poco tiempo. Hoy, apenas tres meses despu√©s de adquirirlo, he ido a encenderlo y en lugar de arrancar se ha quedado parado. Unos segundos m√°s tarde ha soltado un chispazo y ah√≠ se ha quedado. No se le ha dado ning√∫n golpe, ni se ha usado para nada distinto a su finalidad, as√≠ que la √∫nica explicaci√≥n l√≥gica es que viniera defectuoso de f√°brica. Amazon me va a reembolsar el importe en garant√≠a en cuanto lo devuelva, as√≠ que por ese lado no tengo queja.
RESPUESTA: negativo

EJEMPLO: Me equivoqu√© al comprar este soldador. No me sirvi√≥ para soldar una peque√±ita pieza de hierro. El soldador de esta√±o sirve para soldar circuitos impresos con filamentos de cobre muy delgados.
RESPUESTA: negativo

EJEMPLO: He tenido q valorarlo con una estrella pero no s√© la merece porq no dur√≥ ni una semana,con el calor y el agua se despega y para tirarlo.

EJEMPLO: Despu√©s de unos meses de uso cambio mi valoraci√≥n seguido de mi opini√≥n: El dispensador ha dejado de funcionar correctamente, el vendedor s√≥lo me contest√≥ para preguntarme por el n√∫mero de pedido, una vez se lo dije... no he vuelto a saber nada mas de el, ni ha dado soluciones, ni mucho menos ha intentado buscarlas o averiguar por que falla. Por otro lado destacar que ha empezado a oxidarse... Raro ya que el anuncio pon√≠a claramente de Acero Inoxidable... ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ La tecnolog√≠a llega a nuestras casas... hace unos meses compr√© una papelera/basura tambi√©n con sensor de proximidad y apertura autom√°tica. Quede muy contento y me arriesgue con este dispensador de jab√≥n. La principal caracter√≠stica y ventaja es que no &#34;pringas&#34; nada. Puedes tener las manos llenas de jab√≥n o agua y solo con aproximar la mano al sensor el dispensador se activa. Es muy f√°cil de utilizar, dispone de dos botones, + y - estos sirven para graduar la descarga del dispensador. Pulsando m√°s de 3 segundos el +, podemos encenderlo o apagarlo. La carga se efect√∫a por la parte superior desde un tap√≥n de media rosca. Destacar que el dispensador utiliza 4 pilas del tipo A++ que no van incluidas en el paquete.

RESPUESTA: negativo

EJEMPLO: Es un disfraz que solo entra la parte de arriba del traje, viene con una m√°scara d l√°tex gruesa que viene toda doblada y deforme. Pero eso no es lo peor, lo peor es que el traje cuesta 45‚Ç¨ y deber√≠an de darte 45‚Ç¨ por pon√©rtelo, por que es un espanto para el precio que tiene, una tela p√©sima, como un traje de carnaval del bazar oriental de 6‚Ç¨. Y lo de la talla √∫nica... u√±a persona que tenga una complexi√≥n algo fuerte, no le estar√≠a bien. De verdad, es un traje que no vale en absoluto el dinero que cuesta. A si es que nada m√°s verlo, se fue de vuelta.

Con su asa de pl√°stico para cogerla, su tap√≥n ajustable y su correa arriba para que no se le pierda el tap√≥n. La compr√© para mi padre, quer√≠a una botella que fuera de buen material y duradera. Y √©sta es libre de BPA, es decir, bisfenol A, producto t√≥xico que se suele usar para endurecer el pl√°stico. As√≠ se la puede llevar al campo y dejarla al sol en el coche sin que suelte residuos t√≥xicos, como las botellas convencionales o reutilizadas y sin que sea de cristal y se rompa f√°cilmente.

No se le ha dado ning√∫n golpe, ni se ha usado para nada distinto a su finalidad, as√≠ que la √∫nica explicaci√≥n l√≥gica es que viniera defectuoso de f√°brica.

EJEMPLO: Lo compr√© para un regalo y ser√° utilizado con un iPhone X. No he tenido la oportunidad de probarlo con dicho tel√©fono, pero puedo hablar de la excelente calidad de los materiales, es pesado, se siente firme y tiene franjas con goma tanto en la parte superior para que el tel√©fono no se deslice y en su parte inferior para que no se deslice sobre la superficie donde se ubica. S√≥lo lo he conectado para probar las luces (azules) y si colocas un dispositivo para cargar, est√°s parpadean muy lentamente unas 5 veces y luego se apagan definitivamente, cosa que es de agradecer si lo vas a usar en tu mesa de noche. Por ahora lo recomiendo est√©ticamente, luego informar√© de su funcionamiento.
RESPUESTA: positivo

EJEMPLO: Leyendo las opiniones de otros compradores no sabia que esperar. Las habia buenas y malas. Yo me quede a medias. Pense que se quedaria mas cerrado, y aunque aun no lo he probado con frutos secos (almendras...) que era principalmente para lo que lo queria, el sistema de cierre que tiene no me da ninguna seguridad. Para cosas de mayor tama√±o si lo veo adecuado para transportarlas (manzana, platano...) Si en lugar de un unico velcro, la tapa tuviese dos velcros si lo veria seguro (posiblemente me haga yo un apa√±o casero)

EJEMPLO: Aparentemente tiene muy buena calidad y un gran precio para venir tres protectores. Ning√∫n problema a nivel t√°ctil muy transparente, del tama√±o exacto para la pantalla. Sin embargo, el primero no fui capaz de que se adhiriera a la pantalla (quedaba despegado la mitad); pens√© que era mi inexperiencia. El segundo qued√≥ ya mejor, pero a√∫n y todo, no adherido del todo. Y ah√≠ ya no es por exceso de confianza.

RESPUESTA: negativo

EJEMPLO: Llego en el tiempo previsto
RESPUESTA: neutro

EJEMPLO: Env√≠o r√°pido pero la bolsa viene sin caja ( en otras tiendas online viene mejor empaquetado) y por consecuencia la bolsa ten√≠a varios puntos con agujeros... La comida est√° en buen estado pero ya no te da la misma confianza. Fecha de caducidad correcta.

EJEMPLO: El sonido me a parecido bastante decente pero me hacen da√±o en las orejas despu√©s de un tiempo puestos. Los he devuelto
RESPUESTA: neutro

EJEMPLO: Para empezar, si el tiempo de env√≠o es largo, el producto se retrasa por problema de aduanas. Solicit√≥ la devoluci√≥n, ya que es para un regalo y ante la tardanza han adquirido una prenda similar en otro sitio. Amazon me pone en contacto con el vendedor, el cual no facilita la devoluci√≥n. Mientras tanto recibo el paquete y cu√°l es mi sorpresa que el art√≠culo q me env√≠an es un bolso negro, una especie de portafolios pero que nada tiene que ver con el sujetador de lactancia que encargue.

EJEMPLO: Aparentemente tiene muy buena calidad y un gran precio para venir tres protectores. Ning√∫n problema a nivel t√°ctil muy transparente, del tama√±o exacto para la pantalla. Sin embargo, el primero no fui capaz de que se adhiriera a la pantalla (quedaba despegado la mitad); pens√© que era mi inexperiencia.

No se le ha dado ning√∫n golpe, ni se ha usado para nada distinto a su finalidad, as√≠ que la √∫nica explicaci√≥n l√≥gica es que viniera defectuoso de f√°brica.

Me puse en contacto con ellos para tramitar un cambio, pero me pedian que devolviera este primero y luego ellos me mandaban otro, por lo que me quedaba sin movil, creo que lo mas conveniente es igual que viene el mensajero a traerme uno nuevo, a ma vez que se lleve el estropeado... no me podia quedar sin movil ya que solo tengo este y lo necesito. A dia de hoy todav√≠a ando con el movil sin camara trasera... un desastre. NO LO RECOMIENDO PARA NADA!

EJEMPLO: El juego llego en la fecha prevista y precintado, lo curioso es que la caratula de la caja y el libreto interior est√°n en ingles, y no indican por ning√∫n lugar que el juego este doblado al Espa√±ol, tanto los textos como los di√°logos del mismo, tenia serias dudas al comprarlo ya que en las im√°genes que lo anuncia ya se ve que est√°n los textos en ingles, pero el juego esta en espa√±ol como ya he indicado anteriormente, tambi√©n lo indican en la mayor√≠a de las respuestas a preguntas de otros compradores sobre si estaba o no en espa√±ol. De momento lo √∫nico que he hecho ha sido cargarlo en la PS4 para asegurarme de que estaba en espa√±ol, por si tenia que devolverlo en el caso de que se pueda una vez lo has des precintado claro, mas adelante cuando lo juegue ya emitir√© una segunda opini√≥n del mismo.
